# **IFRS17**

The purpose of this section is to provide a basic overview of IFRS17.

## **Overview**

IFRS stands for the **International Financial Reporting Standard**, which is a **global accounting framework** to bring transparency and consistency to financial statements worldwide. IFRS17 is the set of standards that specifically cover the treatment of **insurance contracts**.

It is important to understand that as an accounting framework, the primary purpose of IFRS17 is to provide an accurate and realistic view of the portfolio, as opposed to statutory frameworks which are typically more conservative.

There are a few key themes in IFRS17:

1. Scope - which contracts should be considered under IFRS17?
2. Measurement - How to value contracts?
3. Aggregation - How to group contracts?
4. Presentation - How to present the results?
