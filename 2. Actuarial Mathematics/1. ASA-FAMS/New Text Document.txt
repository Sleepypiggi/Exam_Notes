The second type is known as the **Individual Risk Model**, which makes similar assumptions:

1. **Losses are independent but not necessarily identical**: $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_N$ are independent but MAY have *different distributions*
2. **Frequency is a constant**: $N = n$
3. Typically used for **Group Policies** where there is a fixed number of poliycholders with varying levels of coverage

Generally speaking, it is much better to model frequency and severity **seperately** and then combine into an aggregate loss rather than directly modelling it as it **more accurate and flexible**.
