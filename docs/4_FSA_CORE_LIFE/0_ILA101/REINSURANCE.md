# **Reinsurance**

The purpose of this section is to provide a basic overview of life reinsurance, particularly in the context of risk management.

## **Overview**

Insurance is the process whereby an individual transfers risk to an insurance company. Similarly, reinsurance is the process whereby an **insurance company transfers risk to a reinsurance company**. Since reinsurance companies are also an insurance company themselves, they can also then transfer their risk to **another reinsurance company**, so and so forth. It can be simply understood as insurance for an insurance company.

Formally speaking, a reinsurance contract is known as a **Reinsurance Treaty** (NOT policy). An insurer is said to **Cede** their risk to a Reinsurer, where any unceded amount is known as the **Retained** risk. On the flip side, the reinsurer is said to **Assume** the risk. They can then transfer their risk to another Reinsurer, known as **Retroceding** their risk.

For this reason, the following terms are usually used to refer to the various parties:

* **Insurer**: Ceding Company
* **Reinsurer 1**: Assuming Company
* **Reinsurer 2**: Retrocessionaire
