# **Review of Mathematics**

This section aims to cover the fundamental mathematical concepts needed for actuarial exams.

It assumes that the reader has covered these topics before in school; it is NOT meant to introduce these topics to the reader for the first time.

## **Algebra**

You've all taken Algebra. What are the main questions Algebra asks and answers? (1) Given an expression with variables, re-write it a certain way, so that what you end up with is the same thing as what you started with, just written differently. (2) Given an equation with variables, find all the solutions (the numbers you can substitute in place of the variable that make the equation true). Overall, Algebra is the study of equations.

!!! Warning

    Note that rule 1 and 2 are often **misunderstood**, leading people to believe that the following is true when they are NOT:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \ln (A + B) &= \ln A \cdot \ln B \\
        \ln (A - B) &= \frac{\ln A}{\ln B} 
    \end{aligned}
    $$

## **Linear Algebra**

For the most part, linear algebra is nothing more than a set of tools for dealing with multi-dimensional data, whether it data related to physical systems, or financial systems, or statistical models. Vectors are conceptually nothing more than that.

Some of the transformations or functions that we might want to perform on multi-dimensional data have the special property of being linear. In that case, the maths works out particularly nicely, and the entire transformation can be represented by a matrix. Dealing with linear operators (matrices) rather than arbitrary operators (functions) gives a surprising degree of leverage with which to calculate. That might mean calculating the marginal probability of an event, or estimating the long term statistical behavior of a process for example.

In fact, the mathematical properties of linear systems give us so much leverage with which to interrogate, and analyse, and solve, that even when faced with non-linear problems it is often useful to focus attention to the linear aspects, or even to model the non-linear system using a linear approximation.

To a large extent, this is the reason why so many probabilistic modeling techniques are centered around the multivariate gaussian distribution: Because these models can be represented by a mean vector, and a covariance matrix.

### **Matrices**

### **System of Linear Equations**

First I have to explain what a linear equation is. A linear equation is an equation with multiple variables where the exponent on each variable is 1 and are not passed to other functions. The following are linear equations:

x + y - z = 0
a + b + c + d + e = 17

The following are NOT linear equations

x^2 + y = 3             (x is raised to the 2nd power)
sin(x) + log(y) = 13    (x and y are passed to other functions)

When first introduced, linear algebra is a way to take multiple linear equations and solving them. Take for example:

x + y = 5
x - y = 3

What you learn is another way to write this equation:

M * w = v

Where M is something called a matrix and w is a vector holding x and y and v is a vector holding 5 and 3.

## **Calculus**

Calculus is the the study of *change*:

* **Differential Calculus**: Rate of change
* **Integral Calculus**: Accumulation of changes

Derivatives tell you the *speed* of change while integrals tell you the *total* change.

### **Differential Calculus**

The **Derivative** of a function is the **rate of change** of the function **AT that point**. The process of obtaining it is known as **Differentiation**. 

Simple rules
Chain, product, quotient rule

!!! Note

    Recall that a function $f$ assigns as output $f(x)$ every input $x$.

    The function is said to have a **limit** $L$ at an input $p$ if $f(x)$ moves closer to $L$ as $x$ moves closer to $p$.

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        x \to p,& \space f(x) \to L \\
        \lim_{x \to p} f(x) &= L
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Approximate otherwise impossible to calculate behaviour
    A "Limit" is just a fancy way of saying "I can't know exactly what this answer is, but I can get really dang close and then just assume it's what we think it looks like it is"

    The limit in calculus is when the formula gets close to something but will never touch it. As such, the best answer is that "it".
