# **Options**

This is not the original set of notes for IFM. It was recreated to fit the watered down option syllabus for exam FAM-S.

## **Overview**

Options are contracts where the contract owner has the right to trade an asset at a fixed price on or before a specified future date.

The **buyer** of contract is known as the **Option Holder** while the Seller is known as the **Option Writer**. The buyer pays the seller a **Premium** at time 0 for fulfilling the contract.

The option holder can **Exercise their Right** to trade an asset while the option writer is **Obligated** to fulfil the trade. Naturally, option holders will only exercise their right when it is **favourable** to do so; resulting in a **positive payoff**.

The right to **Buy an Asset** is known as a **Call Option** (Calls) while the right to **Sell an Asset** is known as a **Put Option** (Puts).

!!! Warning

    It is a common misconception to mix up the buyer and seller of the option with buying and selling the asset.

    For both Call and Put Options, there will always be a buyer and a seller.

The fixed price is known as the **Strike Price** $(K)$ and the future date is known as the **Expiration Date** $(T)$.

There are three types of options, based on *when* they can be exercised:

* **American Options**: Any time on or before the expiration date
* **Bermudan Options**: Only during a specified window
* **European Options**: Only on the expiration date itself

For the purposes of this exam, **only European and American Options** will be covered in depth. **European Option Premiums**  are denoted in **Lower Case** $(c_0, p_0)$ while **American Options** are denoted using **Upper Case** $(C_0, P_0)$.

### **Call Options**

Consider a **Long Call Option**:

<center>

|  | Exercise | Do Not Exercise |
| :-:  | :-: | :-: |
| **Intuition** | Cheaper to buy via Call | Expensive to buy via Call |
| **Scenario** | Spot is larger than Strike $(S_T \gt K)$  | Spot is smaller than Strike $(S_T \lt K)$ |
| **Payoff** | Buy at strike and sell at spot $(S_T - K)$  | No trade occurs $(0)$ |
| **Profit** | Positive Profit $(S_T - K - c_0)$ | Negative Profit $(-c_0)$ |

</center>

!!! Note

    The payoff of a call option can be understood using the following example:

    **Exercise** the option to buy the stock at the **lower strike price** $K$ and sell it at the **higher market price** $S_T$, earning the difference.

This can also be expressed in a **piecewise function**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Payoff}_\text{Long} &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 & S_T \leq K, \\
        S_T - K & S_T > K
    \end{cases} \\
    &= \max(S_T – K, 0) \\
    \\
    \text{Profit}_\text{Long} &= \max(S_T – K, 0) – c_0
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    The key takeaway is that Options will only be exercised if there are positive payoffs, but positive payoffs **do not guarantee that there are positive profits**.

Consider the possible payoffs and profits for a long call:

<center>

|  | Payoff | Profit |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Minimum Scenario** | Not exercised, no trade occurs  | Premium already paid  |
| **Minimum Value** | $\text{Payoff} = 0$ | $\text{Profit} = -c_0$  |
| **Maximum Scenario** | Exercised, as high as the stock price | Premium Already paid  |
| **Maximum Value** | $\text{Payoff} = \infty$ | $\text{Profit }= \infty - c_0 = \infty$ |

</center>

!!! Note

    There is no limit for the stock price, thus the maximum stock price is best represented using infinity.

Thus, Long Call Options have **Unlimited Upside** $(\infty)$ and **Limited Downsides** $(0, -c_0)$:

Using the **zero-sum game property**, Short Calls are simply the opposite of their long counterparts:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Payoff}_\text{Short}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 & S_T \leq K, \\
        -(S_T – K) & S_T > K
    \end{cases} \\
    &= -\max(S_T – K, 0) \\
    \\
    \text{Profit}_\text{Short} &= c_0 - \max(S_T – K, 0)
\end{aligned}
$$

Unlike their long counterparts, they have **Limited Upside** $(0, c_0)$ and **Unlimited Downside** $(-\infty)$:

### **Put Options**

A **Long Put Option** is the **opposite** of a long call as the perspective has been flipped to selling instead:

<center>

|  | Exercise | Do Not Exercise |
| :-:  | :-: | :-: |
| **Intuition** | Better to sell via Put | Worse to sell via Put |
| **Scenario** | Spot is smaller than Strike $(S_T \lt K)$  | Spot is larger than Strike $(S_T \gt K)$ |
| **Payoff** | Buy at spot and sell at strike $(K - S_T)$  | No trade occurs $(0)$ |
| **Profit** | Positive Profit $(K - S_T - p_0)$ | Negative Profit $(-p_0)$ |

</center>

!!! Note

    The payoff of a put option can be understood using the following example:

    Buy the stock at the **lower market price** $S_T$ and **exercise** the option to sell it at the **higher strike price** $K$, earning the difference.

This can also be expressed in a **piecewise function**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Payoff}_\text{Long}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        K – S_T & S_T < K, \\
        0 & S_T \geq K
    \end{cases} \\
    &= \max(K - S_T, 0) \\
    \\
    \text{Profit}_\text{Long} &= \max(K - S_T, 0) – p_0
\end{aligned}
$$

<center>

Consider the possible payoffs and profits for a long put:

|  | Payoff | Profit |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Minimum Scenario** | Not exercised, no trade occurs  | Premium already paid  |
| **Minimum Value** | $\text{Payoff} = 0$ | $\text{Profit} = -p_0$  |
| **Maximum Scenario** | Exercised, as high as the strike price | Premium Already paid  |
| **Maximum Value** | $\text{Payoff} = K$ | $\text{Profit }= K - p_0$ |

</center>

!!! Note

    The lowest possible stock price is 0, which is why the maximum possible payoff is *just* the strike price $K-0 = K$.

Thus, Long Call Options have **higher upside** $(K, K-p_0)$ and **lower Downsides** $(0, -c_0)$:

![Long Put Diagrams](Assets/3.%20Options.md/Long%20Put%20Diagrams.png){.center}

Using the **zero-sum game property**, Short Puts are simply the opposite of their long counterparts:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Payoff}_\text{Short}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        -(K – S_T) & S_T < K, \\
        0 & S_T \ge K
    \end{cases} \\
    &= -\max(K - S_T, 0) \\
    \\
    \text{Profit}_\text{Short} &= p_0 - \max(S_T – K, 0)
\end{aligned}
$$

Unlike their long counterparts, they have **Lower Upside** $(0, p_0)$ and **Higher Downside** $(-K, p_0 - K)$:

### **Moneyness**

**Option Moneyness** is a notional indicator about the payoff of a LONG option should it be **exercised immediately at the current spot price**.

It does not matter if the option can or cannot be exercised; it is meant to provide a **rough gauge** about what the spot price *currently* is without having to provide its exact value.

|  | In the Money (ITM) | At the Money (ATM) | Out the Money (OTM) |
| :-: | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Calls** | Positive Payoff $(S_T > K)$| Zero Payoff $(S_T = K)$| Negative Payoff $(S_T < K)$|
| **Puts** | Positive Payoff $(S_T < K)$ | Zero Payoff $(S_T = K)$ | Negative Payoff $(S_T = K)$|

### **Put Call Parity**

**Put Call Parity** (PCP) is an equation that relates Calls, Puts and an underlying Forward Contract:

$$
    p_0 \ – \ c_0 = Ke^{-rt} \ – \ F_0^P
$$

!!! Warning

    The equation takes the perspective of the **initial cashflows** of the position, rather than the terminal cashflow, which is what we are more used to working with.

    * **Positive Sign**: Cashflow in (Revenue from **selling**)
    * **Negative Sign**: Cashflow Out (Cost of **buying**)

#### **No Arbitrage Proof**

Consider the following two portfolios which have the same payoffs:

1. One Long Call & One Short Put
2. One Long Forward only

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Payoff}
    &= \text{Payoff}_\text{Long Call} + \text{Payoff}_\text{Short Put} \\
    &= \max(S_T \ - \ K, \ 0) - \max(K \ - \ S_T, \ 0) \\
    &= S_T \ – \ K
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![PCP Payoff](Assets/3.%20Options.md/PCP%20Payoff.png){.center}

By the **Law of One Price**, both of the portfolios must be **priced the same**, resulting in the PCP equation.

The price of the **first portfolio** is simply the difference in premiums of the two options:

* **Pay premium** for buying the Call
* **Receive premium** selling the Put

$$
    \text{Price}_\text{Options} = - c_0 + p_0
$$

The price of the second portfolio is **harder to determine** as the forward price is **usually paid at expiration rather than at the inception**. Thus, we need to come up with a **replicating portfolio** to determine the time 0 price of a forward.

A forward contract consists of two components:

1. Buying the asset at a **fixed price**; akin to **selling a Zero Coupon Bond**
2. Selling the asset at the **future spot price**; akin to **buying a Prepaid Forward**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Price}_\text{Long Forward}
    &= Ke^{-rt} – F_0^P \\
    &= Ke^{-rt} – S_0 \cdot e^{rT}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    As its name suggests, a prepaid forward is simply a forward contract whose **price is paid for at time 0** rather than at expiration.

    Intuitively, this time 0 price is simply the **PV of the price** that would have been paid at maturity:

    $$
        F^P_0 = \text{PV}(F_0)
    $$

    However, since the forward price depends on the underlying, the prepaid forward price **depends on the underlying** as well:

    <center>
    
    | | Prepaid Forward Price | Forward Price |
    | :-: | :-: | :-: |
    | **No Dividends** | $S_0$ | $S_0 \cdot e^{rT}$ |
    | **Discrete Dividends** | $S_0 - \text{PV Dividends}$ | $S_0 - \text{AV Dividends}$ |
    | **Continuous Dividends** | $S_0 \cdot e^{-qt}$ | $S_0 \cdot e^{(r-q)t}$ |

    </center>

    For simplicity, the no dividend stock was used in the expression above.

Thus, following the law of one price, the price of the two portfolios must be equal:

$$
    p_0 \ – \ c_0 = Ke^{-rt} \ – \ F_0^P
$$

#### **Synthetic Positions**

One practical application of the PCP equation is to easily identify and create replicating portfolios for each of its individual components.

This can be done by simply re-arranging the equation to **match the time 0 cashflow** of the position we want to replicate:

<center>

| Position | Replicating Portfolio |
| :-: | :-: |
| **Long Call** | $-c_0 = -p_0 + Ke^{-rt} - F^P_0$ |
| **Long Put** | $-p_0 = -c_0 - Ke^{-rt} + F^P_0$ |
| **Long ZC Bond** | $-Ke^{-rt} = -p_0 + c_0 - F^P_0$ |
| **Long Stock** | $-F^P_0 = - S_0 = -c_0 - Ke^{-rt} + p_0$ |

</center>

!!! Note

    For a short selling position, simply re-arrange the equations to obtain a positive expression on the LHS.

#### **Risk Free Rate**

Another application of the PCP equation is to **solve for the risk free rates**.

This can be done when PCP is given for multiple dates

$$
\begin{align*}
    p_{0, T} \ – \ c_{0, T} &= Ke^{-rT} – S_0 \\
    p_{t, T} \ – \ c_{t, T} &= Ke^{-r(T-t)} – S_t \\
    \\
    \therefore
    e^{rt}
    &= \frac{Ke^{-rT}}{Ke^{-r(T-t)}} \\
    &= \frac{ p_{0, T} – c_{o, T} + S_0 }{ p_{t, T} – c_{t, T} + S_t}
\end{align*}
$$
