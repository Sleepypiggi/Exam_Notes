# **Binomial Model**

This is not the original set of notes for IFM. It was recreated to fit the watered down option syllabus for exam FAM-S.

## **Overview**

The simplest option pricing model is the **Binomial Model**.

All option pricing models attempt to **predict the price of the underlying at expiration** and thus work backwards to determine the price of the option.

As its name suggests, the binomial model assumes that in **each period** $(h)$, the stock price can only **move in two ways** - Up $(u)$ or Down $(d)$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S_u &= S_0 \cdot u \\
    S_d &= S_0 \cdot d
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is a common misconception to think that up or down is used relative to the starting stock price.

    It is meant to be used **relative to one another**, thus **both can be higher or lower than the starting price** but still smaller than the other.

    $$
        S_u > S_d \equiv  u > d
    $$

However, it is impossible to know which of the two ways that the stock will take. Thus, the probability of going up is denoted as $p$ while the probability of going down is its complement $1-p$.

Given that there only two outcomes, it can easily illustrated via a **probability tree**, which is why they are also referred to as **Binomial Trees**:

They can have a single period (as shown below) or multiple periods. Note that the duration of a single period is $h$ while the **duration of all periods** is denoted as $t$.

## **Single Period Trees**

The simplest Binomial Model assumes that there is only **one period from inception to expiration**. Though unrealistic, they allow us to easily understand the core concepts behind binomial trees.

### **SP Replicating Portfolio Method**

The first way to use a binomial tree is through the **Replicating Portfolio Method**.

As its name suggests, it attempts to create a replicating portfolio that will payoff of the option **regardless of which way the stock moves**. By the law of one price, the **cost of the option is the cost of the portfolio**.

The replicating portfolio is assumed to consist of **Stocks** $(\delta)$ and **Bonds** $(B)$. The payoff of the options are denoted using $V$.

![SP Replicating Portfolio](Assets/5.%20Binomial%20Model.md/SP%20Replicating%20Portfolio.png){.center}

The goal is to set up a **simultaneous equation** for each of the two ways that the price can move and thus solve for the $\Delta$ and $B$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Delta S_0 u + B e^{rh} &= V_u \\
    \Delta S_0 d + B e^{rh} &= V_d
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Bonds are usually stated in terms of their face values, but in here $B$ is the **price at time 0**. Do not be confused!

Subtracting the down scenario from the up scenario,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Delta S_0 u + B e^{rh} - (\Delta S_0 d + B e^{rh}) &= V_u - V_d \\
    \Delta S_0 (u - d) &= V_u - V_d \\
    \Delta &= \frac{V_u - V_d}{S_0 (u - d)}
\end{aligned}
$$

Substituting it back in,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Delta S_0 u + B e^{rh} &= V_u \\
    \frac{V_u - V_d}{S_0 (u - d)} \cdot S_0 u + B e^{rh} &= V_u \\
    \frac{V_u - V_d}{(u - d)} \cdot u + B e^{rh} &= V_u \\
    B e^{rh} &= \frac{uV_d - dV_u}{u-d} \\
    B &= e^{-rt} \cdot \frac{uV_d - dV_u}{u-d}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the price of the option is equal to the price of the portfolio:

$$
    \text{Option Price} = \Delta \cdot S_0 + B
$$

<center>

| Calls | Puts |
| :-: | :-: |
| Buy Stock $(\Delta \gt 0)$ | Sell Stock ($\Delta \lt 0$) |
| Sell Bonds/Borrow Money $(B \lt 0)$ | Buy Bonds/Lend money $(B \gt 0)$ |

</center>

The intuition can be understood as follows:

* **Buy Stock**: Stock will be **sold at maturity**, leading to a **positive terminal cashflow**
* **Sell Bonds**: **Pay back** the bondholder at maurity, leading to a **negative terminal cashflow**

!!! Tip

    The key is remembering the signs of $\delta$ and $B$ must be opposite.

### **SP Risk Neutral Method**

Given the probabilities assigned earlier, the price of the option should be equal to the **PV of the expected payoff**:

$$
    \text{Option Price} = e^{-rt} \cdot [p \cdot V_u + (1-p) \cdot V_d]
$$

Similarly, the initial stock price should be the **PV of the expected final stock prices**, which will allow us to **solve for $p$** and hence calculate the option price:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S_0 &= e^{-rt} \cdot [p \cdot S_0 u + (1 – p) \cdot S_0 d] \\
    e^{rt} &= p \cdot u + (1-p) \cdot d \\
    e^{rt} &= pu + d - pd \\
    e^{rt} – d &= p(u – d) \\
    p &= \frac{e^{rt} - d}{u - d} \\
    p &= \frac{e^{rh} - d}{u - d}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Naturally, for a single period model, $h = t$.

Generally speaking, this method is preferred to the replicating portfolio one as it is much faster - simply plug in the appropriate values into the formula.

!!! Info

    Since $p$ is a probability, it **MUST be between 0 and 1**. Any violation of this would lead to an opportunity for arbitrage:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        0 &< p < 1 \\
        0 &< \frac{e^{rh} - d}{u - d} \\
        0 &< e^{rh} – d < u - d \\
        d &< e^{rh} < u
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    This further drives home the point that $u$ and $d$ do not have to be above or below 1 respectively - they just need to be larger or smaller relative to one another.

## **Multi Period Trees**

A slightly more realistic binomial tree is one that has **multiple periods**, as the stock prices tend to change many times before expiration.

For simplicity, we will only consider a **two period binomial tree**, but the concepts easily extend to more periods.

We can think of multi-period trees as a **single period tree that repeats itself**. As such, all factors $(u, d, p)$ remain **constant throughout the tree**.

The price of the option can thus be found by **recursively solving** one node at a time using any of the above methods from the RHS till the starting node is found.

!!! Warning

    The length of a period is now **different** from the length of the entire option, thus take special care when discounting.

### **MP Replicating Portfolio Method**

Unfortunately, there is **no shortcut** for the replicating portfolio method - the components of the portfolio can only be calculated recursively.

Note that the intuition of the method changes slightly. The portfolio formed at time 0 is a **self-financing portfolio** that will be sold each period to *exactly* purchase a **new portfolio at that time**, such that the final portfolio leading up to expiration will replicate the payoff.

<!-- MP Replicating Portfolio -->

!!! Tip

    If both the future nodes have a value of 0, then the earlier node must be 0 as well.

    This can be used to quickly recurse through layers of trees.

### **MP Risk Neutral Method**

Fortunately, there is a **shortcut** for the risk neutral method. For a two period model, there are **three ending possibilities** - Up Up, Up Down & Down Down.

Instead of having to recursively solve for intermediate option prices, we can use the **Binomial Distribution** to **directly solve for the overall probability** of the ending node and hence immediately solve for the option price.

The binomial distribution has two parameters:

1. **Number of trials**: Number of periods
2. **Probability of Success**: Probability of moving Up

$$
\begin{aligned}
    X &\sim \text{Binomial}(n, p) \\
    \\
    dd &\rightarrow K = 0 \\
    ud &\rightarrow K = 1 \\
    uu &\rightarrow K = 2 \\
    \\
    P(X = K) &= \binom{n}{K} \cdot p^K \cdot (1 – p)^{n-k}
\end{aligned}
$$  

!!! Warning

    The first term **counts the number of ways** that the ending node can be reached. The top and bottom node can only be reached in 1 way each while the **middle node can be reached in 2 ways**.

    It is a common mistake to forget to include the 2 for the middle node.

It is not uncommon for questions to create binomial trees that have **WAY more than 3 periods**. For such questions, there is usually **ONLY 1-2 ending branches with a payoff**. They can be easily found by starting from the lowest or highest possible price, depending on the option.

!!! Tip

    In the off chance that ALL branches have a positive payoff, then the table function should be used to quickly calculate the expectation. 

Given this shortcut, the **risk neutral method is once again preferred** for solving multi-period problems, unless explicitly stated otherwise.
