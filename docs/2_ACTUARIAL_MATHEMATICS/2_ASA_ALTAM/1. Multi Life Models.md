# **Multiple Life Model**

## **Overview**

In FAM-L, the survival model focused on the future lifetime of an individual, used to model insurance on a single life.

In practice, it is possible to have an insurance on **multiple lives**, thus the survival model must be **extended** to model such insurance contracts:

* Life Insurance which pays a benefit on the **first death** of the couple
* Annuities which pays benefits until the **last** of the beneficiaries have died

!!! Tip

    All the concepts and notation from the base survival model also apply to a multi-life setting and thus will not be repeated.

For the purposes of **simplicity**, unless explicitly stated otherwise, there are **two assumptions** to be made:

* Only **two lives** with life status $x$ and $y$
* Lives are **independent**

!!! Note

    Although the most common situation is two lives, it is possible to extend the principles to a case of **3 or more lives**, which some questions may ask.

## **Multiple Life Status**

In order to track when these benefits should be paid, a **multiple life status** is used. For the purposes of this exam, only the following two are considered:

<center>

|        **Joint Life Status**         |          **Last Survivor Status**           |
| :----------------------------------: | :-----------------------------------------: |
| Active as long as **ALL are alive**  | Active as long as **at least one is alive** |
| Fails when the **first person dies** |     Fails when the **last person dies**     |
|                $x:y$                 |              $\overline{x:y}$               |

</center>

The names of the statuses are **intuitive** -- they directly describe the condition which the **statuses are active**.

!!! Tip

    It is important to have a strong understanding of the concept of **Status** that was introduced in FAM-L. Please refer to the [corresponding section](../2. ASA-FAML/3. Life Assurances.md#actuarial-notation) for a quick refresher.

### **Joint Life Status**

A **Joint Life** Status fails when the **first person dies**, thus the future lifetime of the entity is the **smaller** of the two: 

$$
    T_{x:y} = \min (T_{x}, T_{y})
$$

#### **Probability**

There is only **one case** that fulfils the joint life status for survival - both individuals surviving past the specified time. Thus, it can be shown to be the probability that **both $x$ AND $y$ survive**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_{x:y}
    &= P(T_{x:y} \gt t) \\
    &= P(\min (T_{x}, T_{y}) \gt t) \\
    &= P(T_{x} \gt t, T_{y} \gt t) \\
    &= P(T_{x} \gt t) \cdot  P(T_{y} \gt t), \text{Independence} \\
    &= {}_{t}p_{x} \cdot {}_{t}p_{y}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    The multiplication rule still applies in a joint life context, but note the **difference in notation**:

    $$
        {}_{t+u}p_{x:y} = {}_{t}p_{x:y} \cdot {}_{u}p_{x+t:y+t}
    $$

Conversely, the death probability has **multiple cases** to consider:

* $x$ dies before $y$
* $y$ dies before $x$
* BOTH die before $t$

In other words, it is the probability that **at least one** dies (either $x$ OR $y$):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q_{x:y}
    &= 1 - {}_{t}p_{x:y} \\
    &= 1 - {}_{t}p_{x} \cdot {}_{t}p_{y} \\
    &= 1 - (1 - {}_{t}q_{x}) \cdot (1 - {}_{t}q_{y}) \\
    &= 1 - (1 - {}_{t}q_{y} - {}_{t}q_{x} + {}_{t}q_{x} \cdot {}_{t}q_{y}) \\
    &= {}_{t}q_{y} + {}_{t}q_{x} - {}_{t}q_{x} \cdot {}_{t}q_{y}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Remember that the intersection must be subtracted in order to **avoid double counting** of the possibility.

The probability of **deferred death** is analagous to the single life model:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{u \mid t}q_{x:y}
    &= {}_{u}p_{x:y} - {}_{u+t}p_{x:y} \\
    &= {}_{u+t}q_{x:y} - {}_{u}q_{x:y} \\
    &= {}_{u}p_{x:y} \cdot {}_{t}q_{x+u:y+u}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Note that the deferred death probability can be split using the same death probability logic:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{u \mid t}q_{x:y}
        &= {}_{u \mid t}q_{y} + {}_{u \mid t}q_{x} - {}_{u \mid t}q_{x} \cdot {}_{u \mid t}q_{y}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

#### **Force of Mortality**

The force of mortality can be derived from **first principles**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu_{x+t:y+t}
    &= \frac{f_{x:y}(t)}{S_{x:y}(t)} \\
    &= \frac{- \frac{d}{dt} S_{x:y}(t)}{S_{x:y}(t)} \\
    &= - \frac{d}{dt} \ln S_{x:y}(t) \\
    &= - \frac{d}{dt} \ln S_{x}(t) \cdot S_{y}(t) \\
    &= - \frac{d}{dt} (\ln S_{x}(t) + \ln S_{y}(t)) \\
    &= - \frac{d}{dt} \ln S_{x}(t) - \frac{d}{dt} \ln S_{y}(t) \\
    &= \mu_{x+t} + \mu_{y+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the two probabilities can be reformulated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_{x:y} &= e^{- \int \mu_{x+t:y+t}} \\
    {}_{t}q_{x:y} &= \int {}_{t}p_{x:y} \cdot \mu_{x+t:y+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### **Moments**

The **expectation of future life** is also analagous to the single life version:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(T_{x:y})
    &= \mathring{e}_{x:y} \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} t \cdot f_{x:y}(t) \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} {}_{t}p_{x:y} \\    
\end{aligned}
$$

Recall that if the individual has a **maximum age** ($\omega$), the upper limit of the integration should be set to the maximum age:

$$
    \mathring{e}_{x} = \int^{\omega - x}_{0} {}_{t}p_{x}
$$

For a joint life model, the limit of the integration should be set to the **lower maximum age** of the two lives:

$$
    \mathring{e}_{x:y} = \int^{\min(w_{x} - x, w_{y} - y)}_{0} {}_{t}p_{x:y}
$$

The intuition is as follows - the joint life expectation is the **expected time till the first life dies**. Since the individuals will inevitably die at their maximum age, the **maximum possible time** is till the **smaller of the two maximum ages**.

!!! Note

    Overall, the joint life model is analagous to the that of the single life model. For most items, the single life status ($x$) can **simply be replaced** with the joint life subscripts ($x:y$).

### **Last Survivor Status**

A **Last Survivor** life status fails when the **last person** dies, thus the future lifetime of the entity is the **larger** of the two:

$$
    T_{\overline{x:y}} = \max (T_{x}, T_{y})
$$

#### **Probability**

Similarly, there is only one case that fulfils the last survivor status for death - both individuals dying by specified time. Thus, it can be shown to be the probability that **both $x$ AND $y$ die**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q_{\overline{x:y}}
    &= P(T_{\overline{x:y}} \lt t) \\
    &= P(\max (T_{x}, T_{y}) \lt t) \\
    &= P(T_{x} \lt t, T_{y} \lt t) \\
    &= P(T_{x} \lt t) \cdot  P(T_{y} \lt t), \text{Independence} \\
    &= {}_{t}q_{x} \cdot {}_{t}q_{y}
\end{aligned}
$$

Conversely, the probability of survival has **multiple cases** to consider:

* $x$ survives longer than $y$
* $y$ survives longer than $x$
* Both survive past $t$

Similarly, the **survival probability** is the probability that **at least one** survives (either $x$ OR $y$):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_{\overline{x:y}}
    &= 1 - {}_{t}q_{\overline{x:y}} \\
    &= 1 - {}_{t}q_{x} \cdot {}_{t}q_{y} \\
    &= 1 - (1 - {}_{t}p_{x}) \cdot (1 - {}_{t}p_{y}) \\
    &= 1 - (1 - {}_{t}p_{y} - {}_{t}p_{x} + {}_{t}p_{x} \cdot {}_{t}p_{y}) \\
    &= {}_{t}p_{y} + {}_{t}p_{x} - {}_{t}p_{x} \cdot {}_{t}p_{y}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    The multiplication rule **DOES NOT** apply in a last survivor context!

    $$
        {}_{t+u}p_{\overline{x:y}} \ne {}_{t}p_{\overline{x:y}} \cdot {}_{u}p_{\overline{x+t:y+t}}
    $$

    This is because ${}_{u}p_{\overline{x+t:y+t}}$ is the probability that **BOTH** lives have survived $t$ years.
    
    However, **only the third case** of ${}_{t}p_{\overline{x:y}}$ fulfils this description. The two terms are on a **different basis**, thus the multiplication rule **cannot be applied**.

Similarly, the probabilitiy of **deferred death** is analagous to the single life model. However, given that the multiplication rule cannot be applied in a last survivor setting, the **last variation cannot be applied**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{u \mid t}q_{\overline{x:y}}
    &= {}_{u}p_{\overline{x:y}} - {}_{u+t}p_{\overline{x:y}} \\
    &= {}_{u+t}q_{\overline{x:y}} - {}_{u}q_{\overline{x:y}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Notice that the Joint Life and Last Survivor probabilities are **mirror images** of one another:

    <center>

    |       **Joint Life Status**        |     **Last Survivor Status**      |
    | :--------------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
    | 'AND' Logic (Survival perspective) | 'OR' Logic (Survival Perspective) |
    |   'OR' Logic (Death perspective)   |  'AND' Logic (Death Perspective)  |

    </center>

#### **Force of Mortality**

Similarly, the force of mortality can be derived from **first principles**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu_{\overline{x+t:y+t}}
    &= \frac{f_{\overline{x:y}}(t)}{S_{\overline{x:y}}(t)} \\
    &= \frac{- \frac{d}{dt} S_{\overline{x:y}}(t)}{S_{\overline{x:y}}(t)} \\
    \\
    \frac{d}{dt} S_{\overline{x:y}}(t)
    &= \frac{d}{dt} S_{x}(t) + S_{y}(t) - S_{x:y}(t) \\
    &= S_{x}(t) \mu_{x+t} + S_{y}(t) \mu_{y+t} - S_{x:y}(t) \mu_{x+t:y+t} \\
    &= S_{x}(t) \mu_{x+t} + S_{y}(t) \mu_{y+t} - S_{x}(t) S_{y}(t) (\mu_{x+t} + \mu_{y+t}) \\
    &= S_{x}(t) \mu_{x+t} (1 - S_{y}(t)) + S_{y}(t) \mu_{y+t} (1 - S_{x}(t)) \\
    &= {}_{t}p_{x} \mu_{x+t} \cdot {}_{t}q_{y} + {}_{t}p_{y} \mu_{y+t} \cdot {}_{t}q_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore \mu_{\overline{x+t:y+t}}
    &= \frac
        {{}_{t}p_{x} \mu_{x+t} \cdot {}_{t}q_{y} + {}_{t}p_{y} \mu_{y+t} \cdot {}_{t}q_{x}}
        {{}_{t}p_{x} + {}_{t}p_{y} + {}_{t}p_{x:y}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Unlike joint lives, the probabilities **cannot be reformulated** in terms of the force of mortality.

!!! Note

    Recall the intuition for the integration - Life survives till some $t$, then the force of mortality acts on the life at age $x+t$, causing them to die. This is calculated for every possible $t$.

    The last survivor survival probability is the probability that **at least one** survives but the last survivor force is supposed to **act on both lives**. Thus, similar to the multiplication property, there is a **mismatch in basis** and thus no formulation exists.

#### **Moments**

Similarly, the last survivor expectation of life can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(T_{\overline{x:y}})
    &= \mathring{e}_{\overline{x:y}} \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} t \cdot f_{\overline{x:y}}(t) \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} {}_{t}p_{\overline{x:y}} \\    
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, if there is a maximum age to the lives, exceptional logic must be applied:

$$
    \mathring{e}_{\overline{x:y}}
    = \int^{\min (\omega_{x} - x, \omega_{y} - y)}_{0} {}_{t}p_{\overline{x:y}}
    +
    \begin{cases}
        \int^{\omega_{x} - x}_{\omega_{y} - y} {}_{t}p_{x} \\
        \int^{\omega_{y} - y}_{\omega_{x} - x} {}_{t}p_{y}
    \end{cases}
$$

The intuition is similar to before - the last survivor expectation measures the **expected time till both lives die**:

* The **first term** calculates the probability that both lives die by the smaller maximum age
* One of the lives WILL die by this age while the **other may survive** (different maximum age)
* Thus, there must be an **additional term** to account for the **remaining lifetime** of the surviving life
* The **second term** will use the **expectation of a single life** since only one life remains

!!! Note

    To better illustrate this, consider the following example:

    * $x$ is currently aged 65 and has a maximum lifetime of 75
    * $y$ is currently aged 60 but has a maximum lifetime of 85

    $$
        \mathring{e}_{\overline{65:60}}
        = \int^{10}_{0} {}_{t}p_{\overline{60:65}} + \int^{25}_{10} {}_{t}p_{\overline{60}} 
    $$

    There is no need to update the age of the individual in the second term - it is implied via the limits of the integration.

### **Multi Life Relationship**

There is an interesting relationship between the two life statuses:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    T_{x:y} + T_{\overline{x:y}}
    &= \min (T_{x}, T_{y}) + \max (T_{x}, T_{y}) \\
    &= T_{x} + T_{y}
\end{aligned}
$$

The key is understanding that this can only occur when there are **exactly two lives**, **regardless of the actual distribution**:

<center>

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
    \text{}
        & \text{X Dies First}
        & \text{Y Dies First} \\
\hline
    T_{x:y}
        & \min(T_{x}, T_{y}) = T_{x}
        & \min(T_{x}, T_{y}) = T_{y} \\
\hline
    T_{\overline{x:y}}
        & \max(T_{x}, T_{y}) = T_{y}
        & \max(T_{x}, T_{y}) = T_{x} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

</center>

Thus, any **linear function** of the random variable will follow the same relationship:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_{x:y} + {}_{t}p_{\overline{x:y}} &= {}_{t}p_{x} + {}_{t}p_{y} \\
    {}_{t}q_{x:y} + {}_{t}q_{\overline{x:y}} &= {}_{t}q_{x} + {}_{t}q_{y} \\
    e_{x:y} + e_{\overline{x:y}} &= e_{x} + e_{y}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The above relationship applies to the second moment, but NOT the variance:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        E(T_{x:y}) + E(T_{\overline{x:y}})
        &= E(T_{x}) + E(T_{y})
        \\
        E(T^{2}_{x:y}) + E(T^{2}_{\overline{x:y}})
        &= E(T^{2}_{x}) + E(T^{2}_{y})
        \\
        \text{Var}(T_{x:y}) + \text{Var}(T_{\overline{x:y}})
        &\ne \text{Var}(T_{x}) + \text{Var}(T_{y})
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    The second moment is still a **linear function** (expectation), which is why it is valid. The variance is a non-linear function, which is why the relationship no longer applies. 

!!! Tip

    The above proof can be used **without** the need for independence. Thus, this is the preferred method of calculating values for last survivor statuses, as they are less straightforward.


Another interesting relationship is to consider the **Covariance** between Joint Lives and Last Survivor statuses:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Cov}(T_{x:y}, T_{\overline{x:y}})
    &= E(T_{x:y} \cdot T_{\overline{x:y}}) - E(T_{x:y}) \cdot E(T_{\overline{x:y}}) \\
    &= E(T_{x} \cdot T_{y}) - E(T_{x:y}) \cdot [E(T_{x}) + E(T_{y}) - E(T_{x:y})] \\
    &= E(T_{x}) \cdot E(T_{y}) - E(T_{x:y}) E(T_{x}) - E(T_{x:y}) E(T_{y}) + [E(T_{x:y})]^2 \\
    &= E(T_{x}) \cdot [E(T_{y}) - E(T_{x:y})] - E(T_{x:y}) \cdot [E(T_{y}) - E(T_{x:y})] \\
    &= [E(T_{x}) - E(T_{x:y})] \cdot [E(T_{y}) - E(T_{x:y})] \\
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    This measures the **Covariance between the Joint Life and Last Survivor** variables, NOT the individual lives. Remember that a key assumption was made that the individual lives are **Independent**:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{Cov}(T_{x}, T_{y}) &= 0 \\
        E(T_{x}, T_{y}) - E(T_{x}) \cdot E(T_{y}) &= 0 \\
        E(T_{x}, T_{y}) &= E(T_{x}) \cdot E(T_{y})
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    However, the joint life and last survivor statuses are NOT independent because they share the underlying independent lives.

!!! Tip

    The key to the proof uses similar logic to before. Given exactly two lives, the following relationship always holds true:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        T_{x:y} \cdot T_{\overline{x:y}}
        &= \min (T_{x}, T_{y}) \cdot \max (T_{x}, T_{y}) \\
        &= T_{x} \cdot T_{y}   
    \end{aligned}
    $$

### **Common Shock**

Consider a variation of the survival model where the two lives are **dependent**:

* Let $T^{*}_{x}$ and $T^{*}_{y}$ represent the future lifetime in the **absence** of a common shock
* Let $T_{x}$ and $T_{y}$ represent the future lifetime in the **presence** of a common shock
* Let $Z$ be the random variable representing **time until a Common Shock** that can kill both individuals simultaneously (EG. Earthquake)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    T_{x} = \min (T^{*}_{x}, Z) \\
    T_{y} = \min (T^{*}_{y}, Z) \\
    \\
    Z \sim \text{Exponential}(\lambda)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    $Z$ tends to follows an exponential distribution as it is used to model time to an event. However, the question could set it to follow any distribution.

!!! Warning

    The absence of a common shock does **NOT imply independence**! As stated in the opening, always check the given probabilities and functions to determine independence.

$T_{x}$ and $T_{y}$ are **dependent** because they share $Z$. However, it is important to distinguish that $T^{*}_{x}$, $T^{*}_{y}$ and $Z$ are **independent**.

For simplicity, we consider only the results for the Joint Life status. If the last survivor variations are needed, it is recommended to **convert from the joint life** versions.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_{x}
    &= P(T_{x} \gt t) \\
    &= P(\min (T^{*}_{x}, Z) \gt t) \\
    &= P(T^{*}_{x} \gt t) \cdot P(Z \gt t), \ \text{Independence} \\
    &= {}_{t}p^{*}_{x} \cdot e^{-\lambda t} \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{t}p_{y} &= {}_{t}p^{*}_{y} \cdot e^{-\lambda t} \\
    \\
    {}_{t}p_{x:y}
    &= P(\min (T_{x}, T_{y}) \gt t) \\
    &= P(\min (T^{*}_{x},T^{*}_{y}, Z) \gt t) \\
    &= P(T^{*}_{x} \gt t) \cdot P(T^{*}_{y} \gt t) \cdot P(Z \gt t), \ \text{Independence} \\
    &= {}_{t}p^{*}_{x} \cdot {}_{t}p^{*}_{y} \cdot e^{-\lambda t} \\
    &= {}_{t}p^{*}_{x:y} \cdot e^{-\lambda t} \\
    \\
    \mu_{x+t:y+t}
    &= \frac{d}{dt} \ln {}_{t}p_{x:y} \\
    &= \frac{d}{dt} \ln ({}_{t}p_{x} \cdot {}_{t}p_{y} \cdot e^{-\lambda t}) \\
    &= \frac{d}{dt} \ln {}_{t}p_{x} + \ln {}_{t}p_{y} - \lambda t \\
    &= \mu_{x+t} + \mu_{y+t} - \lambda
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is a **common misconception** to think that common shock only affects the multi-life probabilities. In reality, they affect the **single life probabilities** as well.

    For instance, assume the common shock was due to **driving a car** (EG. Risk of both individuals dying in a car crash). Even after one party dies, the other will still continue to drive a car, and thus would be exposed to the **same risk** as before.

Consider the expression for an assurance or annuity with a common shock:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{a}_{x:y}
    &= \int {}_{t}p_{x:y} \cdot e^{-\delta t} \\
    &= \int {}_{t}p^{*}_{x:y} \cdot e^{-\lambda t} \cdot e^{-\delta t} \\
    &= \int {}_{t}p^{*}_{x:y} \cdot e^{-(\lambda + \delta)t} \\
    &= \bar{a}^{*}_{x:y} |_{\delta^{*} = \lambda + \delta}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Fractional Ages**

The same fractional age assumptions from the single life model apply in a multi-life setting as well. There is **NO need** to memorize a special formula - convert them into single life probabilities and apply the **usual conversions** from there. For instance, if UDD was assumed:

For instance, if the Uniform Distribution of Deaths was assumed:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{s}q_{x:y}
    &= 1 - {}_{s}p_{x:y} \\
    &= 1 - {}_{s}p_{x} \cdot {}_{s}p_{y} \\
    &= 1 - (1-{}_{s}q_{x}) \cdot (1-{}_{s}q_{y}) \\
    &= \dots
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Contingent Events**

The life statuses introduced do NOT specify the **order of deaths** - they do not care *specifically* if $x$ or $y$ dies first.

When the order of deaths are specified, they are known as **Contingent Events**. This is because the probability is **contingent on the other life** being alive or dead at the time.

<center>

|           **Dies First**            |           **Dies Last**            |
| :---------------------------------: | :--------------------------------: |
| Probability that $x$ dies **first** | Probability that $x$ dies **last** |

</center>

!!! Note

    The notation used is *similar* to what was introduced for **term assurances**, where the number on the **accent specifies the order of failure**.

### **Probability**

The probability of $x$ **dying first** can be understood as the following:

* Both $x$ and $y$ surviving to some time
* Then the force of mortality acts on $x$ **only**, causing only $x$ to die
* Thus, $x$ dies before $y$

$$
    {}_{t}q^{1}_{x:y}
    = \int^{t}_{0} {}_{t}p_{x:y} \cdot \mu_{x+t}
$$

!!! Tip

    The same intuition of integrating the scenario we want to achieve can be used to construct any of the death probabilities.

Conversely, the probability of $x$ **dying second** can be understood as the following:

* $y$ dies while $x$ survives
* Then the force of mortality acts on $x$, causing only $x$ to die as well
* Thus, $x$ dies after $y$

$$
    {}_{t}q^{2}_{x:y}
    = \int^{t}_{0} {}_{t}q_{y} \cdot {}_{t}p_{x} \cdot \mu_{x+t}
$$

Note that the two are **NOT complementary** to one another:

* It might *seem* intuitive that if $x$ dies first, the opposite case must mean that $y$ dies first
* However, this is **NOT the case** as there is a **timeframe** $t$ attached to the probabilities
* The **opposite** of $x$ dying first within $t$ years is **not only** $y$ dying first; both could survive past $t$ years and die at some future time
* Thus, only when **no specific timeframes** are considered, then they are complements:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{\infty}q^{1}_{x:y} + {}_{\infty}q^{\> \> \> 1}_{x:y} &= 1 \\
    {}_{\infty}q^{2}_{x:y} + {}_{\infty}q^{\> \> \> 2}_{x:y} &= 1 \\
    \\
    {}_{t}q^{1}_{x:y} + {}_{t}q^{\> \> \> 1}_{x:y} & \ne 1 \\
    {}_{t}q^{2}_{x:y} + {}_{t}q^{\> \> \> 2}_{x:y} & \ne 1 \\
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Following a similar line of reasoning, given only two lives, $x$ dying first must necessarily mean that $y$ dies second, but only if **no specific timeframe** is considered:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{\infty}q^{1}_{x:y} &= {}_{\infty}q^{\> \> \> 1}_{x:y} \\
        {}_{t}q^{1}_{x:y} & \ne {}_{t}q^{\> \> \> 1}_{x:y}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Thus, the equality will only hold if we **account for the other possibility** - of $y$ living past $t$:

    $$
        {}_{t}q^{1}_{x:y} = {}_{t}q^{\ \ \ 2}_{x:y} + {}_{t}q_{x} \cdot {}_{t}p_{y} 
    $$

!!! Warning

    The timeframes for the two are different:

    * ${}_{t}q^{1}_{x:y}$: $y$ dies after $x$, NOT necessarily WITHIN $t$ years
    * ${}_{t}q^{2}_{x:y}$: $x$ dies after $y$, WITHIN $t$ years

Similar to last survivor probabilities, it assumes that BOTH individuals are **alive at the start of the period**. Thus, the deferred probability must account for **both lives surviving till the deferred point** (time $u$) and then dying in the specified order within $t$ years:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{u \mid t}q^1_{x:y} &= {}_{u}p_{x:y} \cdot {}_{t}q^{1}_{x+u:y+u} \\
    {}_{u \mid t}q^2_{x:y} &= {}_{u}p_{x:y} \cdot {}_{t}q^{2}_{x+u:y+u} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Contingent Relationships**

The most intuitive relationship is that for a **single life** to die, it must **either die first or die second**:

$$
    {}_{t}q_{x} = {}_{t}q^{1}_{x:y} + {}_{t}q^{2}_{x:y}
$$

A relationship can be formed with the **multi-life** probabilities as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(\text{First Death})
    &= P(\text{X dies first}) + P(\text{Y dies first}) \\
    {}_{t}q_{x:y} &= {}_{t}q^{1}_{x:y} + {}_{t}q^{\> \> \> 1}_{x:y}  \\
    \\
    P(\text{Last Death}) 
    &= P(\text{X dies Last}) + P(\text{Y dies Last}) \\
    {}_{t}q_{\overline{x:y}} &= {}_{t}q^{2}_{x:y} + {}_{t}q^{\> \> \> 2}_{x:y}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Technically speaking, the true probability is the following:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        P(\text{First Death})
        &= P(\text{X dies first}) + P(\text{Y dies first}) \\
        &- P(\text{X and Y die together}) \\
        \\
        P(\text{Last Death})
        &= P(\text{X dies Last}) + P(\text{Y dies Last}) \\
        &- P(\text{X and Y die together})
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    The above assumes that is it **not possible** for both $x$ and $y$ to die at the same time - **no common shock** that could kill both simultaneously. Thus, the **last term is zero**.

    $$
        \therefore P(\text{X and Y die together}) = 0
    $$

## **Insurance Applications**

Multi-life assurances and annuities are **analagous to their single life counterparts**. Similar to probability, in many cases, the single life subscript can simply be replaced with the multi-life subscript.

This section highlights key differences when considering a second life.

### **Joint Life**

Consider the definition of a joint life assurance and annuity:

* **Joint Life Assurance** - Pays a death benefit **upon the first death** between $x$ and $y$
* **Joint Life Annuity** - Pays a benefit **till the first death** between $x$ and $y$ (while both are alive)

Using first principles, the EPV of the **Joint Life** assurances and annuities can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A_{x:y} &= \sum v^{k} {}_{k \mid}q_{x:y} \\
    \bar{A}_{x:y} &= \int v^{t} {}_{t}p_{x:y} \mu_{x+t:y+t} \\
    \\
    \ddot{a}_{x:y} &= \sum v^{k} {}_{k}p_{x:y} \\
    \bar{a}_{x:y} &= \int v^{t} {}_{t}p_{x:y} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The usual **term conversions** apply as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A_{x:y:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= A_{x:y} - {}_{n}E_{x:y} \cdot A_{x+n:y+n} \\
    \ddot{a}_{x:y:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \ddot{a}_{x:y} - {}_{n}E_{x:y} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+n:y+n}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Using first principles, the joint life pure endowment function can be calculated as:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{n}E_{x:y}
        &= v^{n} \cdot {}_{n}p_{x:y} \\
        &= v^{n} \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot {}_{n}p_{y} \\
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    However, it can also be expressed in terms of the single life PE functions, which is **more convenient** to calculate from the SULT:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{n}E_{x:y}
        &= v^{n} {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot {}_{n}p_{y} \\
        &= v^{n} {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot v^{n} {}_{n}p_{y} \cdot (1+i)^{n} \\
        &= {}_{n}E_{x} \cdot {}_{n}E_{y} \cdot (1+i)^{n}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

Lastly, the usual conversion between Assurances and Annuities hold as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \ddot{a}_{x:y} &= \frac{1 - A_{x:y}}{d} \\
    \bar{a}_{x:y} &= \frac{1 - \bar{A}_{x:y}}{\delta}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Last Survivor**

Consider the definition of a last survivor assurance and annuity:

* **Last Survivor Assurance** - Pays a death benefit on the **second death** between $x$ and $y$
* **Last Survivor Annuity** - Pays a benefit **till the second death** between $x$ and $y$ (while at least one is alive)

Given the **complexity** in the survival probability for last survivors, it is **difficult** to calculate the EPV using from principles. Thus, we can leverage on the **previous relationship** in the random variables:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    v^{T_{x:y}} + v^{T_{\overline{x:y}}} &= v^{T_{x}} + v^{T_{y}} \\
    A_{x:y} + A_{\overline{x:y}} &= A_{x} + A_{y} \\
    \ddot{a}_{x:y} + \ddot{a}_{\overline{x:y}} &= \ddot{a}_{x} + \ddot{a}_{y} \\
    {}_{n}E_{x:y} + {}_{n}E_{\overline{x:y}} &= {}_{n}E_{x} + {}_{n}E_{y} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Another reason why this method is preferred is because the Joint Life and Single Life values are **already provided on the SULT**; it is much easier to utilize them rather than to go bottom's up.

!!! Warning

    The usual method for term conversions **do NOT** apply in a last survivor context:

    $$
        A_{\overbrace{\overline{x:y}}:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}^{\> \> \> 1}
        \ne A_{\overline{x:y}} - {}_{n}E_{\overline{x:y}} \cdot A_{\overline{x+n:y+n}}
    $$

    Similar to before, this is due to the **difference in basis** - the second term is on the basis that both lives are alive while the PE term only assumes that at least one will survive (not both).

    This means that even for last survivor TAs, they **MUST** be calculated from the joint life version.

!!! Note

    It is possible for questions to ask for the EPV of a TA with a short duration, requiring manual calculation of the EPV. Thus, it is important to take note of the following **quirk** in last survivor probabilities:

    In the first year, there is **only one way to fail** the last survivor status - both individuals die in the year:

    $$
        P(K_{\overline{x:y}} = 0) = q_{x} \cdot q_{y}
    $$

    In every **subsequent year**, there are three possible cases::

    * $y$ dies in the first year and $x$ dies in the second year
    * $x$ dies in the first year and $y$ dies in the second year
    * Both $x$ and $y$ die in the second year

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        P(K_{\overline{x:y}} = 1)
        &= q_{y} \cdot p_{x} q_{x+1} \\
        &+ q_{x} \cdot p_{y} q_{y+1} \\
        &+ p_{x} q_{x+1} \cdot p_{y} q_{y+1}  
    \end{aligned}
    $$

### **Variance**

Recall that the Joint Life and Last Survivor functions themselves are **not independent** of each other. Thus, if asked to determine their Variance, the **Covariance** must be considered:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Var} \left(v^{T_{x:y}} + v^{T_{\overline{x:y}}} \right)
    &= \text{Var} \left(v^{T_{x:y}} \right) + \text{Var} \left(v^{T_{\overline{x:y}}} \right)
    + \text{Cov} \left(v^{T_{x:y}}, v^{T_{\overline{x:y}}} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Using similar results from FAM-L and Covariance proof from before, the individual components can be computed:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Var} \left(v^{T_{x:y}} \right)
    &= {}^{2}A_{x:y} - (A_{x:y})^{2}
    \\
    \text{Var} \left(v^{T_{\overline{x:y}}} \right)
    &= {}^{2}A_{\overline{x:y}} - (A_{\overline{x:y}})^{2}
    \\
    \text{Cov} \left(v^{T_{x:y}}, v^{T_{\overline{x:y}}} \right)
    &= \left(A_{x} - A_{x:y} \right) \left(A_{y} - A_{x:y} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    The Covariance for annuities are **slightly different**:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{Cov} \left(\bar{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{T_{x:y}}}, \bar{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{T_{\overline{x:y}}}} \right)
        &= \text{Cov} \left(\frac{1-v^{T_{x:y}}}{\delta}, \frac{1-v^{T_{\overline{x:y}}}}{\delta} \right) \\
        &= \frac{1}{\delta} \cdot \frac{1}{\delta} \text{Cov} \left(1-v^{T_{x:y}}, 1-v^{T_{\overline{x:y}}} \right) \\
        &= \frac{1}{\delta^2} \cdot \text{Cov} \left(-v^{T_{x:y}}, -v^{T_{\overline{x:y}}} \right) \\
        &= \frac{1}{\delta^2} \cdot (-1)(-1) \cdot \text{Cov} \left(v^{T_{x:y}}, v^{T_{\overline{x:y}}} \right) \\
        &= \frac{1}{\delta^2} \cdot \text{Cov} \left(v^{T_{x:y}}, v^{T_{\overline{x:y}}} \right) \\
        &= \frac{1}{\delta^2} \cdot \left(\bar{A}_{x} - \bar{A}_{x:y} \right) \left(\bar{A}_{y} - \bar{A}_{x:y} \right)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    The above is consistent with what was covered in FAM-L, where the variance of an annuity is **derived from an assurance**. However, it can be further simplified to reach an **analagous expression** to the assurances:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{Cov} \left(\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{T_{x:y}}}, \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{T_{\overline{x:y}}}} \right)
        &= \frac{1}{\delta^2} \cdot \left(\bar{A}_{x} - \bar{A}_{x:y} \right) \left(\bar{A}_{y} - \bar{A}_{x:y} \right) \\
        &= \frac{1}{\delta^2} \cdot \left(\bar{A}_{x} - \bar{A}_{x:y} + 1 - 1 \right) \left(\bar{A}_{y} - \bar{A}_{x:y} + 1 - 1 \right) \\
        &= \frac{1}{\delta^2} \cdot \left[-1 + \bar{A}_{x} + 1 - \bar{A}_{x:y} \right] \left[-1 + \bar{A}_{y} + 1 - \bar{A}_{x:y} \right] \\
        &= \frac{1}{\delta^2} \cdot \left[- (1 - \bar{A}_{x}) + (1 - \bar{A}_{x:y}) \right] \left[- (1 - \bar{A}_{y}) + (1 - \bar{A}_{x:y}) \right] \\
        &= \frac{1}{\delta^2} \cdot (-1)(-1) \left[(1 - \bar{A}_{x}) - (1 - \bar{A}_{x:y}) \right] \left[(1 - \bar{A}_{y}) - (1 - \bar{A}_{x:y}) \right] \\
        &= \frac{\left[(1 - \bar{A}_{x}) - (1 - \bar{A}_{x:y}) \right]}{\delta} \frac{\left[(1 - \bar{A}_{y}) - (1 - \bar{A}_{x:y}) \right]}{\delta} \\
        &= \left(\frac{1 - \bar{A}_{x}}{\delta} - \frac{1 - \bar{A}_{x:y}}{\delta} \right)
            - \left(\frac{1 - \bar{A}_{y}}{\delta} - \frac{1 - \bar{A}_{x:y}}{\delta} \right) \\
        &= \left(\bar{a}_{x} - \bar{a}_{x:y} \right) \left(\bar{a}_{y} - \bar{a}_{x:y} \right)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

### **Contingent Assurance**

A contingent assurance pays a death benefit upon the death of $x$, depending on **whether $y$ is alive or dead at that time**; depending on the **order of death**.

Using first principles, we can calculate the EPV as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}^{1}_{x:y} &= \int {}_{t}p_{x:y} \cdot \mu_{x+t} \\
    \bar{A}^{2}_{x:y} &= \int {}_{t}q_{y} {}_{t}p_{x} \mu_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

However, it is much to leverage on the **relationships** that were previously covered:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A_{x} &= A^{1}_{x:y} + A^{2}_{x:y} \\
    A_{x:y} &= A^{1}_{x:y} + A^{\> \> \> 1}_{x:y} \\
    A_{\overline{x:y}} &= A^{2}_{x:y} + A^{\> \> \> 2}_{x:y} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Contingent Annuity**

A contingent annuity pays a benefit as long as $y$ alive, **depending on whether $x$ is alive or dead at that time**; depending on the **order of death**. In particular, a **Reversionary Annuity** is a form of contingent annuity that pays a benefit as long as $y$ is alive, provided that **$x$ has died**.

!!! Note

    The **trigger** for the annuity starting is the *death* of $x$, since it is contingent on this event. This is somewhat hard to understand, as we **dont usually associate death starting an annuity**.

    A reversionary annuity can thus be phrased as **paying a stream of benefits upon the death** of $x$, payable as long as $y$ is alive.

$\ddot{a}_{x \mid y}$ is the notation for a reversionary annuity where:

* $x$ is the **failing life**; life that has to die
* $y$ is the **annuitant**; life that must stay alive

A reversionary annuity can be understood as a **deferred annuity** where the deferment period is the time where both individuals are alive. The key difference from FAM-L is that this period is now variable, rather than fixed:

$$
    \ddot{a}_{x \mid y} = \ddot{a}_{y} - \ddot{a}_{x:y} \\
$$

!!! Tip

    The above result can be understood using the following logic:

    * $\ddot{a}_{y}$ pays a benefit until $y$ dies
    * $\ddot{a}_{x:y}$ pays a benefit until the first person dies

    As long as **$x$ dies BEFORE $y$**, the former will always have **more payments than the latter**. Thus, the difference is equivalent to a reversionary annuity:

    <!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
    ![Reversionary Annuity](Assets/1.%20Multi%20Life%20Models.md/Reversionary%20Annuity.png){.center}

    However, if $x$ dies AFTER $y$, then the **two terms are equal** and thus the difference is 0; equivalent to the reversionary annuity NOT making any payments:
    
    <!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
    ![Reversionary Annuity 2](Assets/1.%20Multi%20Life%20Models.md/Reversionary%20Annuity%202.png){.center}

Another variation of contingent annuities is one that makes payments as long as **only one person is alive** (*regardless* of which person). Intuitively, this is simply the **combination of two reversionary annuities**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Annuity Only One Alive}
    &= \ddot{a}_{x \mid y} + \ddot{a}_{y \mid x} \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{y} - \ddot{a}_{x:y} + \ddot{a}_{x} - \ddot{a}_{x:y} \\
    &= (\ddot{a}_{y} + \ddot{a}_{x} - \ddot{a}_{x:y}) - \ddot{a}_{x:y} \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{\overline{x:y}} - \ddot{a}_{x:y}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Special Annuity](Assets/1.%20Multi%20Life%20Models.md/Special%20Annuity.png){.center}

!!! Tip

    Notice that the above is essentially the formula for **'XOR' logic** - only making a payment when either $x$ or $y$ is alive, but NOT both:

    <!-- Obtained from Wikipedia -->
    ![XOR_Diagram](Assets/1.%20Multi%20Life%20Models.md/XOR_Diagram.png){.center}

!!! Note

    The same logic can be applied to be probabilities as well. Note that when there are only two individuals, the probability of **only person being alive** is the same as the probability of **only person dying**:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{P(Exactly One Lives)}
        &= \text{P(Exactly One Dies)} \\
        &= p_{\overline{x:y}} - p_{x:y} \\  
        &= q_{x:y} - q_{\overline{x:y}} \\
        &= 1 - (1 - q_{x})(1 - q_{y}) - q_{x} \cdot q_{y} \\
        &= 1 - (1 - q_{y} - q{x} + q_{x} \cdot q_{y}) - q_{x} \cdot q_{y} \\
        &= q_{y} + q_{x} - 2 \cdot q_{x} \cdot q_{y} \\
        &= q_{y} - q_{x} \cdot q_{y} + q_{x} - q_{x} \cdot q_{y} \\
        &= q_{y} (1 - q_{y}) + q_{x} (1 - q_{y}) \\
        &= q_{y} p_{x} + q_{x} p_{y} \\
        &= \text{P(X lives, Y dies)} + \text{P(X dies, Y lives)}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

### **Approximations**

All the usual approximations from FAM-L to convert an assurance/annuity from payable yearly to more frequently apply in a multi-life setting as well. For instance, consider the woolhouse approximation:d

$$
    \ddot{a}^{(m)}_{x:y} = \ddot{a}_{x:y} - \frac{m-1}{2m}
$$

!!! Note

    Whole Life **Last Survivor** annuities can be **converted directly** as well:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \ddot{a}^{(m)}_{\overline{x:y}}
        &= \ddot{a}^{(m)}_{x} + \ddot{a}^{(m)}_{y} - \ddot{a}v_{x:y} \\
        &= \ddot{a}_{x} - \frac{m-1}{2m} + \ddot{a}_{y} - \frac{m-1}{2m}
        - (\ddot{a}_{x:y} - \frac{m-1}{2m}) \\
        &= \ddot{a}_{x} - \frac{m-1}{2m} + \ddot{a}_{y} - \frac{m-1}{2m}
        - \ddot{a}_{x:y} + \frac{m-1}{2m} \\
        &= \ddot{a}_{x} + \ddot{a}_{y} - \ddot{a}_{x:y} - \frac{m-1}{2m} \\
        &= \ddot{a}_{\overline{x:y}} - \frac{m-1}{2m}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

The same rules from FAM-L apply as well - the approximation only works for **whole life** annuities. For any other type of annuity, decompose it into the a combination of whole life annuities then apply the conversion.
