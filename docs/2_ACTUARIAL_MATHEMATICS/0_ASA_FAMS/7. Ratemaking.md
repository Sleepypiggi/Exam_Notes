# **Ratemaking**

## **Fundamental Equation**

**Ratemaking** is the process of determining **how much premium** to charge a policyholder. It is important to set rates such that there is **enough premium** collected to cover losses and expenses while still generating a profit for the insurer.

This is illustrated through the **Fundamental Insurance Equation**:

$$
    \text{Premium} = \text{Loss} + \text{Expense} + \text{Profit}
$$

The remaining subsections will go in-depth into **each component** of this equation.

## **Expenses**

There are two main types of expenses - **Loss Adjustment Expenses** (LAE) and **Other Expenses**.

LAE are expenses that are **incurred during the claim settlement process** and are typically included as **part of the incurred losses**.

They can be further split into two categories:

* **Allocated LAE** (ALAE): Expenses **associated with** a specific claim (EG. Lawyer's Fee)
* **Unallocated LAE** (ULAE): Expenses that are **NOT associated** with a specific claim (EG. Salaries)

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to include LAE as part of one of the expenses.

As its name suggests, other expenses is a catch all for non-LAE expenses. They are generally split into two categories:

* **Variable Expenses** ($\text{VE}$): Expenses that vary with premium (EG. Commissions)
* **Fixed Expenses** ($\text{FE}$): Expenses that do NOT vary with premium (EG. Salaries)

$$
    \text{Expenses} = \text{VE} \cdot P + \text{FE}
$$

## **Profit**

Profits can be included in ratemaking either implicitly or explicitly.

By using **more conservative estimates** than usual, **actual experience should be better** than expected, which **implicitly** results in profit for the insurer.

Alternatively, they can **explicitly include a margin for the target profit** (T) in the ratemaking process, as seen in the fundamental insurance equation.

$$
    \pi = \pi_{T} \cdot P
$$

Based on this, we can find the **target loss ratio** such that the premiums are sufficient to cover both variable expenses and meet the profitability target, known as the **Permissible Loss Ratio** (PLR):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P &= L + \text{FE} + \text{VE} \cdot P + \pi_{T} \cdot P \\
    P - \text{VE} \cdot P - \pi_{T} \cdot P &= L + \text{FE} \\
    P \cdot (\text{PLR}) &= L + \text{FE} \\
    \text{PLR} &= \frac{L + \text{FE}}{P} \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{PLR} &= \text{PLR}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Losses**

Losses are the main component of determining premiums. However, before historical losses can be used, they must be **Aggregated**, **Developed** & **Trended**.

### **Loss Aggregation**

Losses can be aggregated according to the following categories:

1. **Calendar Year** (CY): Losses that only occur from **1 Jan to 31 Dec** of that year
2. **Accident Year** (AY): ALL losses from an **accident that occurred** in a specified 12 month period  
3. **Policy Year** (PY): ALL losses from a **policy that was issued** in a specified 12 month period

Unless otherwise stated, the **specified 12 month period follows the calendar year**. In otherwise, Policy Year 2015 refers to a policy that was issued from 1 Jan 2015 to 31 Dec 2015.

Since AY and PY consider ALL losses, they usually have a **cut off date** known as the **Valuation Date**, such that they **only consider the losses occuring at or before that date**.

The valuation date is usually referred to as the losses "As at" or "As of". They refer to the **cumulative losses** at that time.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{CY Paid} &= \text{Sum of all paid losses in CY} \\
    \text{CY Incurred} &= \text{CY Paid} + \text{Change in Case Reserves} \\
    \\
    \text{AY/PY Paid} &= \text{Sum of all paid losses at Valuation Date} \\
    \text{AY/PY Incurred} &= \text{AY/PY Paid} + \text{Case Reserves at Valuation Date}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the default is to assume that PY and AY follow CY, unless stated otherwise as well, the **valuation date is the end of the year**.

**Most questions already provide the aggregated losses**. However, if **given raw data**, we are expected to know how to aggregate them ourselves using the above method.

### **Loss Development**

Using the above aggregations, the losses can be **developed to their ultimate values** using the **chain ladder method** described in the previous reserving section.

### **Loss Trending**

Lastly, **losses must be trended** to account for factors that drive losses such as inflation, increased medical costs or technological advances.

!!! Warning

    Loss Trending and Development are **often confused with one another** as both involve adjusting the loss amount. Some people also believe that only one of them should be applied to a loss because applying both would **double count certain factors**, known as the **Overlap Fallacy**.

    However, note that they are extremely different concepts:

    **Loss Development** is about bringing an **immature loss to its ultimate amount**, as losses take time to be **discovered and reported** to the insurer.

    **Loss Trending** is about bringing the **ultimate loss today to what it would be at a future time**, as losses are also subject to **external factors such as inflation**.

Similar to development, trending involves using historical data to find trends and then project them into the future:

$$
    \text{Trended Ultimate Loss} = \text{Ultimate Loss} \cdot (1 + \text{Trend Factor})^\text{Trend Period}
$$

However, finding trend factors is out of scope for this exam. Thus, the main focus will be on **determining the trend period**.

Formally speaking, it is the difference between the **midpoint** of the **Experience Period** and the midpoint of the **Forecast Period**:

* **Experience Period**: Duration in which losses can occur for policies with **old rates**
* **Forecast Period**: Duration in which losses can occur for policies with **new rates**
* The midpoint is used as a general "summary" of each period

$$
    \text{Trend Period} = \text{Forecast Period Midpoint} - \text{Experience Period Midpoint}
$$

![Trend Period](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/Trend%20Period.png){.center}

!!! Tip

    For all date related computations, assume that the **base unit is 1 year**.

    Most questions provides dates that are usually on the **same day of the month** (EG. 1st). The calculation mainly involves a **difference in months**:

    $$
        \text{1 Jan} - \text{1 Oct} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}
    $$    

    However, questions can also provide dates that are on **different days of the month** (EG. 15th vs 1st). The **difference in days** must also be accounted for:

    $$
        \text{1 Jan} - \text{15 Oct} = \frac{2.5}{12} = \frac{5}{24}
    $$

    The most common mistake when calculating dates is getting a quarter and third mixed up:

    * 3 Months difference is a quarter $\frac{1}{4}$
    * 4 Months difference is a third $\frac{1}{3}$
    * The 3 and 4 get swapped in the denominator!

The difficulty comes from determining the length and hence midpoint of each period.

If the periods are determined via **AY**, then the length of the period is simply the **calendar year**. Thus, its midpoint is always the **middle of the year**.

$$
    \text{AY Period} = \text{Middle of Calendar Year}
$$

If the periods are determined via **PY**, then the length of the period is the **CY PLUS the length of the policy**.

Assuming that policies are **written uniformly throughout the year**, it means that there will be policies **written on the first and last day of the PY**:

* **Written on First Day**: Expires on the last day of PY
* **Written on Last Day**: Expires on last day of PY plus policy term

Both of the above policies are written using the same set of rates. Thus, the **maximum possible timespan** that policies written with the same set of rates can exists are:

$$
    \text{PY Period} = \text{Rates Duration} + \text{Policy Term}
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![PY Period](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/PY%20Period.png){.center}

!!! Warning

    The above example assumed that **rates are in effect for one year** exactly at the start and end of the PY.
    
    In other words, it assumes that the new rates are put into place at the start of the next PY. In practice, rates can **start and end at any time**.

### **Other Trending Methods**

Rather than using *just one* trending factor, insurers might sometimes use multiple trending factors to obtain a trended ultimate and then take a **weighted average** of all of them instead.

Similarly, they could also use **regression** to project the trended ultimate. Based on the regression slope $(m)$, the trended ultimate can be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    L^T &= L^U + mt \\
    \\
    \ln L^T &= \ln L^U + mt \\
    \ln \frac{L^T}{L^U} &= mt \\
    \frac{L^T}{L^U} &= e^{mt} \\
    L^T &= L^U \cdot e^{mt}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Premiums**

Similar to losses, historical premiums must be first aggregated and then brough to the current level via **trending**.

### **Premium Aggregation**

Since premiums cannot be linked to specific accidents, they can only be aggregated by CY or PY.

Premiums can also be categorized in three ways, based on their **accounting** definitions:

* **Written Premium** (WP): Total premium collected
* **Earned Premium** (EP): Portion of premium used to provide insurance
* **Unearned Premium** (UP): Portion of premium that has yet to be used to provide insurance

$$
    \text{WP} = \text{EP} + \text{UP}
$$

The above are all calculated at a specific point in time known as the **Valuation Date**. For CY aggregation, the valuation date is always the **end of the year** while for PY aggregation it can be any date.

$$
    \text{EP}
    = \text{WP} \cdot \frac{|\text{Valuation Date} - \text{Policy Start Date}|}{\text{Policy Term}}
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Earned Unearned Premiums](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/Earned%20Unearned%20Premiums.png)

!!! Tip

    For a *few* policies, this process can be easily repeated. However, when policies are **written uniformly throughout the year**, there will be way *too many* to be feasibly use this method.

    Since policies are written uniformly, each month writes an equal number of policies. We can decompose the problem into **monthly computations**.

    $$
        \text{WP}_\text{Per Month} = \text{WP} \cdot \frac{1}{12}
    $$

    Depending on the policy term, the premiums for some months **may already be fully earned**. For instance, if the valuation date is the **end of the year** and policies lasts 3 months, then all policies written in **January to September** would have been **fully earned by the end of the year**.

    $$
        \text{EP}_{\text{Fully Earned Month}} = \text{WP}_\text{Per Month}
    $$

    For the remaining months, their premiums are only **partially earned**. Since policies are written evenly throughout the month, we can use the **middle of the month** as a reference point. The earned portion can then be calculated using the original method:

    $$
        \text{EP}_\text{Partially Earned Month}
        = \text{WP}_\text{Per Month} \cdot \frac{|\text{Valuation Date} - \text{Middle Month}|}{\text{Policy Term}}
    $$

    Thus, the total EP is the combination of ALL the fully and partically earned months:

    $$
        \text{EP}
        = \sum \text{EP}_{\text{Fully Earned Month}} + \sum \text{EP}_\text{Partially Earned Month}
    $$

    The above is used to calculate the earned premium over a **particular year**. The same logic can thus be extended to the earned premium over a **particular month**.

As with loss aggregation, **most questions already provide the aggregated premiums**. However, if given raw data, we are expected to know how to aggregate them ourselves using the above method.

### **Premium Trending**

Premiums then need to be brought to their current level, similar to how ultimate losses were trended.

#### **Extension of Exposures**

The first method is known as the **Extension of Exposures** method, which adjusts premiums for each individual policyholder by accounting for rate changes in every single exposure.

For some background, premiums are calculated as the product of a rate and an some base:

$$
    \text{Premium} = \text{Exposure Base} \cdot \text{Rate per Exposure}
$$

However, exposures need not be continuous (EG. Gender - Male, Female). Possible exposures are known as **Risk Classifications**. For simplicity, this section will consider only **discrete exposures**.

These premiums are then **calculated relatively** - in other words, it assumes some **base risk classification** will be charged a certain premium and then **adjusts it accordingly if the risk classification is different**.

!!! Note

    The concept is similar to dummy variable regression where $x=0$ is assumed as the base case and then changes accordingly.

Formally speaking, the base risk classification is known as the **Base Cell**, which is usually the **most common risk class**. The **premium for this risk class** is known as the **Base Rate**.

In order to adjust the premiums, **each risk class has its own rate**, collectively known as the **Rate Differentials** for the rating variable. Naturally, the rates for the base cell are 1 to reflect that *it is* the base.

$$
    \text{Premium} = \text{Base Rate} \cdot \text{Rate Relativities}
$$

<!-- Coaching Actuaries -->
![Rate Relativity](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/Rate%20Relativity.png){.center}

Thus, old premiums are brought to the current level by simply **recalculating them at the current rates** instead:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Old Premium} &= 300 \cdot 1.2 \cdot 0.8 = 288 \\
    \text{On Level Premium} &= 330 \cdot 1.30 \cdot 0.70 = 300.30
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Extension of Rates](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/Extension%20of%20Rates.png)

!!! Tip

    Rather than providing the exact rates, rates are often expressed in the form of rate changes:

    <!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
    ![Rate Changes](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/Rate%20Changes.png){.center}

    $$
        \text{New Rates} = \text{Old Rates} \cdot \text{Rate Change}
    $$

    Thus, rather than needing to have the exact rates, we can simply **multiply the old premiums by the rate changes** to bring them to the current level.

#### **Parallelogram Method**

Although the above method is more "correct", the problem is that it requires highly granular data for every policyholder and the individual rates.

However, insurers may only have access to aggregated data for both premiums and rates, in which case the **Parallelogram Method** must be used.

A series of rate changes can be reorganized into a **series of parallelograms**:

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Parallelogram Method](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/Parallelogram%20Method.png){.center}

Each **square represents a calendar year** while **diagonal lines represent policies**. Each diagonal has a horizontal length equal to the policy term in years.

!!! Tip

    In practice, we **only need 3 squares**, with the middle square being the CY whose premium we would like to trend upwards.

In particular, **diagonals start from the first day of a new rate**. Thus, the area **between any two diagonals forms a Parellogram**, which represent all policies written under a particular set of rates.

!!! Note

    Recall from Loss Trending that the timespan is from the first day of rates to the last day of rates plus the policy term; the parallelograms are a **visualization of the timespan**.

Since the length of each square is exactly one calendar year, it is equal to 1. Thus, the **area of the square is 1**.

Due to all the diagonals, the square can be "broken up" into different shapes, whose **area must all still sum to 1**:

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Geometry Review](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/Geometry%20Review.png){.center}

Each shape within the square corresponds to **policies written under different set of rates**. Assuming that **premiums are aggregated by CY**, the premiums collected in the year is the sum of the premiums from all these policies.

Since the area of the square is 1, the area of these different shapes that represent different rates can be **intepreted as weights**. Thus, the aggregate premium collected for that year is based on the **weighted average rate** of all rates within the square:

$$
    \text{Average Rate} = \sum \text{Area} \cdot \text{Yearly Rate}
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Geometry Weighted Average](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/Geometry%20Weighted%20Average.png){.center}

!!! Note

    The rate for each year is the **cumultive rate changes** up till that time.

    Using the given rate changes in the table above,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{CY 2014 Rates} &= P \\
        \text{CY 2015 Rates} &= P \cdot (1.05) \\
        \text{CY 2016 Rates} &= P \cdot (1.05)(1.1) \\
        \text{CY 2017 Rates} &= P \cdot (1.05)(1.1)(0.98) \\
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    $P$ can also be substituted for $1$, as it is usually **cancelled** out when calculating the on-level factor.

Recall from the extension method that the Historical and Current premiums are essentially the same exposure base multiplied by different rates. Using that logic, we can come up with an adjustment factor that transforms historical premiums to current premiums, known as the **On Level Factor**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Historical Premium} &= \text{Exposure Base} \cdot \text{Average Rate} \\
    \\
    \text{Current Premium}
    &= \text{Exposure Base} \cdot \text{Current Rate} \\
    &= \text{Exposure Base} \cdot \text{Current Rate} \cdot \frac{\text{Average Rate}}{\text{Average Rate}} \\
    &= \text{Exposure Base} \cdot \text{Average Rate} \cdot \frac{\text{Current Rate}}{\text{Average Rate}} \\
    &= \text{Historical Premium} \cdot \text{On Level Factor} \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{On Level Factor} &= \frac{\text{Current Rate}}{\text{Average Rate}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is a common misconception to think that the On Level Factor must be greater than 1.

    There is no hard rule that states that premiums must increase over time.

#### **Paralellogram Geometry**

The difficulty comes from being able to correctly calculate the **lengths of various components**, which requires us to understand the geometry behind a parallelogram.

Every parallelogram has the following basic layout:

<!-- Self Made -->
![General Parallelogram](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/General%20Parallelogram.png){.center}

!!! Warning

    If the policy term is lesser than one year, then depending on the start date, the policy may not even cross even to the next year.

    For instance, a 6 month policy bought on 1 Jun will end on 1 Jan, not crossing the CY boundary. Thus, always perform a sense check when dealing with a policy of under a year.

    <!-- Self Made -->
    ![Half Year Parallelogram](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/Half%20Year%20Parallelogram.png){.center}

Given the start date of the rates, the time to the start of the next year $(x)$ can be calculated. Assuming a **policy term of 1 year**, the length of the small triangle is simply the complement $(1-x)$.

<!-- Self Made -->
![One Year Parallelogram](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/1%20Year%20Parallelogram.png){.center}

In order to calculate the height of the small triangle, geometric rules must be used.

Since the two triangles share the **same angle at the tip** and a right angle, the two triangles thus have the **same angle at every vertice** and thus are considered to be **similar triangles**.

For two similar triangles, the ratio of their lengths and heights must be equal:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \frac{L_1}{H_1} &= \frac{L_2}{H_2} \\
    \\
    \frac{1}{1} &= \frac{x}{H_2} \\
    \therefore H_2 &= x
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![1 Year Similarity](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/1%20Year%20Similarity.png){.center}

Using the above method, the dimensions of any triangles can be found and hence used to calculate the area. Generally speaking, it is better to calculate the **area of the two triangles** and then take the **area of the trapezium as their complement**.

<!-- Self Made -->
![1 Year Final Parallelogram](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/1%20Year%20Final%20Parallelogram.png){.center}

!!! Warning

    Although 1 year policy terms are the most common, do NOT mistakenly believe that the triangles are always isoceles.

    Repeating the same process for a policy term of 6 months will result in a **non-isoceles triangle**:

    <!-- Self Made -->
    ![Half year similarity](Assets/7.%20Ratemaking.md/Half%20year%20similarity.png){.center}

    Thus, it is best to apply **first principles to determine the dimensions** of the triangles.

### **Indicative Premium**

The last part of the ratemaking process is to ensure that there the **premiums are sufficient** to cover future losses, expenses and target profits.

The **sufficient premium** is known as the **Indicative Premium** $(P^I)$, which can be solved for using the fundamental insurance equation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P^I &= L + \text{FE} + \text{VE} \cdot P^I + \pi_{T} \cdot P \\
    P^I - \text{VE} \cdot P^I - \pi_{T} \cdot P^I &= L + \text{FE} \\
    P^I \cdot (\text{PLR}) &= L + \text{FE} \\
    P^I &= \frac{L + \text{FE}}{\text{PLR}} \\
    P^I &= \frac{L + \text{FE}}{\text{PLR}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The difficulty comes from filling in the various values. Depending on the type of data provided, there are two methods to do so.

#### **Loss Ratio Method**

Instead of directly calculating the indicative premium, we can calculate a **factor to adjust the current premium** to the indicated level, known as a **Rate Change**.

$$
    \text{Indicative Premium} = \text{Current Premium} \cdot \text{Rate Change}
$$

This method is known as the **Loss Ratio Method** because it converts the **loss on the RHS into a loss ratio** by dividing the entire equation by the current premium:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P^I &= \frac{L + \text{FE}}{\text{PLR}} \\
    \frac{P^I}{P^c} &= \frac{\frac{L}{P^c} + \frac{\text{FE}}{P^c}}{\text{PLR}} \\
    \frac{P^I}{P^c} - 1 &= \frac{LR + \frac{\text{FE}}{P^c}}{\text{PLR}} - 1 \\
    \frac{P^I - P^c}{P^c} &= \frac{LR + \frac{\text{FE}}{P^c}}{\text{PLR}} - 1 \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{Rate Change} &= \frac{LR + \frac{\text{FE}}{P^c}}{\text{PLR}} - 1
\end{aligned}
$$

#### **Pure Premium Method**

Alternatively, the indicative premium can be calculated directly using the **Pure Premium Method**.

Similar to the loss ratio method, it involves dividing the equation by the **Number of Exposures** $(n^e)$, which turns the **loss on the RHS into a pure premium** (net premium):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P^I &= \frac{L + \text{FE}}{\text{PLR}1} \\
    \frac{P^I}{n^e} &= \frac{\frac{L}{n^e} + \frac{\text{FE}}{n^e}}{\text{PLR}} \\
    \frac{P^I}{n^e} &= \frac{\bar{L} + \bar{FE}}{\text{PLR}} \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{Indicative Rate} &= \frac{\bar{L} + \bar{FE}}{\text{PLR}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The bar notation is used in this context as they are technically the **average losses and fixed expenses per exposure**.

!!! Warning

    Although both methods are equivalent, they are NOT expected to produce the similar results. Do NOT use them to sense check one another.

#### **Practical Tips**

Remember that this is the **final step** for ratemaking. This means that **all other steps must be completed** before this.

Thus, if the question provides **non-trended or non-aggregated** data, then it must be done before continuing.

If **multiple years** of data are provided, then the indicative premium should be calculated using the **weighted average** of the Loss Ratios $(\text{LR})$ or Pure Premiums $(\bar{L})$. The question will usually **specify the weights** to use.

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to confuse this step with the aggregation step.

    Aggregation adds up the raw losses and premiums, while thie step takes the weighted average of LRs and Pure Premiums.
