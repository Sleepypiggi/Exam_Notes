# **Policy Modifications**

## **Key Concepts**

**Policy Modifications** are the parts of an insurance policy that defines **how much the insurer is required to pay** for each loss incurred by the policyholder.

Before continuing, there are **two key notations** ($\land, {}_{+}$)that will be used throughout this subsection:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \min (a, b)
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        a,& a \lt b \\
        b,& a \ge b
    \end{cases} \\
    &= a \land b \\
    \\
    \max (a-b, 0)
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& a \lt b \\
        a-b,& a \ge b
    \end{cases} \\
    &= (a-b)_{+} \\
    &= \text{Non-negative part; floored at 0}
\end{aligned}
$$

The two are related through the following expression:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    (a-b)_{+} &= a - (a \land b) \\
    \\
    \text{If } a &\gt b \text{,} \\
    (a-b)_{+} &= a-b \\
    a - (a \land b) &= a-b \\
    \therefore (a-b)_{+} &= a - (a \land b) \\
    \\
    \text{If } a &\lt b \text{,} \\
    (a-b)_{+} &= 0 \\
    a - (a \land b) &= a-a = 0 \\
    \therefore (a-b)_{+} &= a - (a \land b) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

There are three key **random variables** regarding claims and losses:

1. $X$ is the **Ground Up Loss** variable, representing the **total loss incurred by the policyholder**
2. $Y^L$ is the **Payment per Loss** variable, representing the **amount paid by the insurer**
3. $Y^P$ is the **Payment per Payment** variable, representing the amount paid by the insurer **given that there is a positive payment**

To properly understand the difference between the three, consider an example of a policy with a **deductible of 800**, but in two different situations:

<center>

| $X$ or Loss | $Y^L$ | $Y^P$ |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| 2000 | 1200 | 1200 |
| 600 | 0 | **NOT Observed** |

</center>

There are two main takeaways:

* If $Y^L > 0$, then $Y^P = Y^L$
* If $Y^L = 0$, then $Y^P$ is NOT Observed
* $\therefore Y^P = Y^L \mid Y^L > 0$

!!! Warning

    Do NOT mistakenly think that $Y^P$ being unobserved is equivalent to $Y^P = 0$. They are completely DIFFERENT.

$Y^L$ can be thought of as a **two point mixture distribution** of $Y^P$ and a **not-so-random-variable that always takes 0**. Thus, it can also be thought of as a conditional distribution dependent on whether $Y^L \gt 0$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F_{Y^L} (t)
    &= F_{Y_L | Y^L > 0} (t) \cdot P(Y^L > 0) + F_{Y_L | Y^L = 0} (t) \cdot P(Y^L = 0) \\
    &= F_{Y^P} (t) \cdot P(Y^L > 0) + F_{0} (t) \cdot P(Y^L = 0) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Let $\pi = P(Y^L > 0)$, which becomes the weight of the mixture:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F_{Y^L} (t) &= F_{Y_P} (t) \cdot \pi + F_{0}(t) \cdot (1-\pi)  \\
    1 - F_{Y^L} (t) &= [1 - F_{Y_P} (t)] \cdot \pi + [1-F_{0}(t)] \cdot (1-\pi) \\
    S_{Y^L} (t) &= S_{Y_P} (t) \cdot \pi \\
    \\
    E \left(Y^L \right) &= E \left(Y^P \right) \cdot \pi + E(0) \cdot (1-\pi) \\
    E \left(Y^L \right) &= E \left(Y^L \right) \cdot \pi
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the values for $Y^L$ and $Y^P$ can be **easily converted to one another** by using the weight of the mixture (probability of a positive payment).

Additionally, since $Y^P$ is essentially $Y^L$ being conditional on itself, we can easily obtain its **conditional distribution**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{Y_P} (y)
    &= f_{Y^L \mid Y^L \gt 0} (y) \\
    &= \frac{f_{Y^L} (y)}{P(Y^L \gt 0)}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    If $Y^L$ follows the exponential or geometric distribution which are memoryless, then the distribution of $Y^P$ is the **same** as $Y^L$.

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        Y^L &\sim \text{Exponential/Geometric} \\
        Y^P &= X \mid X \gt d \\
        Y^P &\sim \text{Exponential/Geometric}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Similarly, if $Y^L$ follows the uniform distribution, then the distribution of $Y^P$ can be easily calculated:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        X &\sim \text{Uniform} (a,b) \\
        Y^P &= X - d \mid X \gt d \\
        \therefore Y^P &\sim \text{Uniform} (a, b-d)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

Note that for all losses **without deductibles**, a loss will always result in a claim. Thus, $Y^P = Y^L$.

## **Ordinary Deductibles**

The first type of policy modification is known as a **Deductible**, denoted by $d$. It is the amount that the policyholder is responsible for paying before the insurer pays a claim:

* If the loss amount **does not exceed** the deductible, then the insurer will **pay out nothing**
* If it does **exceed the deductible**, then the insurer will **pay out the excess**

For each loss $X$, the **policyholder** is responsible for paying losses up to $d$. It is denoted by $X \land d$, which is known as the **Limited Loss Variable**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    X \land d
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        X,& X \le d\\
        d,& X \gt d
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

The **insurer** will then cover the excess amount, represented by the **Payment Per Loss** variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& X \le d\\
        X - d,& X \gt d
    \end{cases} \\
    &= (X-d)_{+} \\
    &= X - (X \land d) \\
    \\
    \therefore E \left(Y^L \right) &= E(X) - E(X \land d)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Since $E(X)$ is easily calculated, the main issue is calculating $E(X \land d)$:

    * $X$ follows a **known distribution** -- $E(X \land d)$ formula provided
    * $X$ does NOT follow a **known distribution** -- $E(X \land d)$ calculated through first principles

    Most of the time, such questions assume that **losses are discrete** (EG. 40, 80, 120 & 160) with some deductible **not exactly equal** to any of the loss amounts (EG. 100).

    The tricky part is remembering that once the loss is **larger the deductible, only the deductible will be paid**:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
    X \land 100
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        40,& X = 40 \\
        80,& X = 80 \\
        100,& X \ge 120
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    \therefore E(X \land 100)
    &= 40 \cdot P(X = 40) \\
    &+ 80 \cdot P(X = 80) \\
    &+ 100 \cdot [1 - P(X = 40) - P(X = 80)]
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    The key is understanding that the final case is simply the deductible itself, with its probability being the **complement of all other cases below the deductible**.

    The same logic can be applied in an **empirical context**, where $E(X \land d)$ is the **average of the total LIMITED claim sizes**:

    $$
        E(X \land 300) = \frac{x + y + (100 - 22) \cdot 300}{100}
    $$

    The key is once again understanding that if the loss per claim is above $d$, then it is limited to $d$. Since we are interested in total claim sizes, we need to **multiply it by the number of limited claims** as well.

In practice, policyholders would **not report losses below the deductible**. Thus, the insurers payment is better represented by the **Payment Per Payment** variable, also known as the **Excess Loss Variable**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^P
    &= Y^L \mid Y^L \gt 0 \\
    &=  X - d \mid X \gt d \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        \text{Undefined},& X \le d\\
        X - d,& X \gt d
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    f_{Y_P} (y)
    &= \frac{f_{Y^L} (y)}{P(Y^L \gt 0)} \\
    &= \frac{f_{Y^L} (y)}{P(X \gt d)} \\
    &= \frac{f_{Y^L} (y)}{1 - F_{X}(d)} \\
    \\
    E \left(Y^P \right)
    &= \int^{\infty}_{d} y^P \cdot f_{Y_P} (y) \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{d} (x-d) \cdot \frac{f_{Y^L} (y)}{1 - F_{X}(d)} \\
    &= \frac{1}{1 - F_{X}(d)} \cdot \int^{\infty}_{d} (x-d) \cdot f_{Y^L} (y) \\
    &= \frac{E \left(Y^L \right)}{1 - F_{X}(d)} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The key metric insurers look out for is the **Loss Elimintation Ratio** (LER), which is a measure of **how much the insurer saves** by imposing the deductible; how much less they end up paying.

Formally, it is defined as the **ratio** of a **decrease in expected payment** when a deductible is imposed to the expected payment without a deductible:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{LER}
    &= \frac{E(X) - E \left(Y^L \right)}{E(X)} \\
    &= \frac{E(X) - E [(X-d)_{+}]}{E(X)} \\
    &= \frac{E \left[X-(X-d)_{+} \right]}{E(X)} \\
    &= \frac{E(X \land d)}{E(X)}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Variance of Payments**

Unfortunately, the formula for expectation **ONLY holds for the first raw moment**. Thus, the second moment can only be calculated via **first principles**.

If **severity is continuous**, then the **survival function method** (FAM-L) can be used to calculate the second moment:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E \left(Y^L \right)
    &= E \left[(X-d)_{+} \right] \\
    &= \int^{d}_{0} 0 \cdot f(x) + \int^{\infty}_{d} (x-d) \cdot f(x) \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{d} (x-d) \cdot f(x) \\
    \\
    E \left[ \left(Y^L \right) \right]^2
    &= \int^{\infty}_{d} (x-d)^2 \cdot f(x) \\
    &= [S_X(x) \cdot (x-d)^2]^{\infty}_{d} - \int^{\infty}_{d} -S(x) \cdot 2(x-d) \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{d} S(x) \cdot 2(x-d)
\end{aligned}
$$

If **severity is discrete**, then determine **all possible values** for $Y^L$ and then **manually calculate** the second moment as the sum product.

If the **variance of the payment per payment** variable is required, then the **same conversion** applies for the second moment as well:

$$
    E \left[ \left(Y^P \right) \right]^2 = \frac{E \left[ \left(Y^L \right) \right]^2}{P(X \gt d)}
$$

### **Franchise Deductibles**

A special kind of deductible is known as **Franchise Deductible**. Unlike a regular deductible that will only pay the excess, it will pay the **full amount**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L_{\text{Franchise}}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& X \le d\\
        X,& X \gt d
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    E \left(Y^L_{\text{Franchise}} \right)
    &= \int^{d}_{0} 0 \cdot f(x) + \int^{\infty}_{d} x \cdot f(x) \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{d} x \cdot f(x) \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{d} (x-d+d) \cdot f(x) \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{d} (x-d) \cdot f(x) + d \cdot \int^{\infty}_{d} f(x) \\
    &= E[Y^L] + d \cdot [1-F_{X}(d)]
\end{aligned}
$$

The same relationship as before can be applied for the payment per payment variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^P
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        \text{Undefined},& X \le d\\
        X,& X \gt d
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    E \left(Y^P_{\text{Franchise}} \right)
    &= \frac{E \left(Y^L_{\text{Franchise}} \right)}{1 - F_{X}(d)} \\
    &= \frac{E[Y^L] + d \cdot [1-F_{X}(d)]}{1 - F_{X}(d)} \\
    &= \frac{E[Y^L]}{1 - F_{X}(d)} + \frac{d \cdot [1-F_{X}(d)]}{1 - F_{X}(d)} \\
    &= E \left(Y^P \right) + d
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Disapearing Deductibles**

Another kind of special deductible is known as a **Disappearing Deductible**.

For losses below a **lower threshold** $(L)$, there is a **constant deductible**. After an **upper threshold** $(U)$, there is **no deductible**. Between the two thresholds, the **deductible decreases linearly**.

The **payment** made by the insurer is visualized below:

<!-- Self Made -->
![Disappearing Deductible](Assets/4.%20Policy%20Modifications.md/Disappearing%20Deductible.png){.center}

There are four parts to the graph, depending on the size of the losses:

1. **Smaller than the deductible**: No payment is made
2. **Smaller than the lower threshold**: Payment in excess of flat deductible; increases at the same rate as losses
3. **Between lower and upper threshold**: Payment in excess of linear deductible; increases faster than losses
4. **Above upper threshold**: Payment equal to loss; increases at the same rate as losses

The key is to find an **graphical equation** representing the portion of the graph we are interested in:

$$
    y = mx + c
$$

By plugging in the loss amount, we can determine the payment made.

## **Coinsurance**

Another type of policy modification is known as **Coinsurance**, denoted by $\alpha$. As its name suggests, the key idea is that **both the insurer and policyholder insure the loss**.

The insurer covers $\alpha$ proportion of the loss while the poliyholder covers the remaining $1-\alpha$ proportion.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L &= \alpha \cdot X \\
    E \left(Y^L \right) &= \alpha \cdot E(X) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Co-insurance usually refers to the portion of the loss that the *policyholder* is responsible for. However, for this exam, we are taking the insurers perspective, thus it refers to the amount that the *insurer* is responsible for. Do not confuse the two!

### **Coinsurance & Deductibles**

Coinsurance on its own is a simple concept - the difficulty comes about when it is **mixed with a Deductible**.

If the coinsurance is applied **after the deductible**:

1. Entire loss $X$ is applied against the deductible; poliycholder pays first $d$
2. Coinsurance is applied against the **remaining loss**; insurer pays remaining $\alpha(X-d)$
3. Unless stated otherwise, it is usually **assumed that the coinsurance is applied after the deductible**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& X \le d \\
        \alpha \cdot (X - d),& X \gt d
    \end{cases} \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        \alpha \cdot 0,& X \le d \\
        \alpha \cdot (X - d),& X \gt d
    \end{cases} \\
    &= \alpha \cdot
        \begin{cases}
        0,& X \le d \\
        (X - d),& X \gt d
    \end{cases} \\
    &= \alpha \cdot (X-d)_{+} \\
    &= \alpha \cdot [X - (X \land d)] \\
    \\
    E \left(Y^L \right)
    &= \alpha \cdot E [X - (X \land d)] \\
    &= \alpha \cdot [E(X) - E(X \land d)] \\
    \\
    E \left(Y^P \right) &= \frac{E \left(Y^L \right)}{1 - F_{X}(d)}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The key is remembering that any value multiplied by 0 is 0, thus the coinsurance factor can be factored out.

If the coinsurance is applied **before the deductible**,

1. Coinsurance is applied against the **full loss**; insurer covers $\alpha X$
2. Deductible is applied against the **coinsured amount**; insurer pays $\alpha X - d$
3. The deductible **effectively increases** to $\frac{d}{a}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& \alpha X \le d \\
        \alpha X - d,& \alpha X \gt d
    \end{cases} \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& X \le \frac{d}{a} \\
        \alpha \cdot \left(X - \frac{d}{a} \right),& X \gt \frac{d}{a}
    \end{cases} \\
    &= \alpha \cdot \left(X - \frac{d}{a} \right)_{+} \\
    &=  \alpha \cdot \left[X - \left(X \land \frac{d}{a} \right) \right] \\
    \\
    E \left(Y^L \right)
    &= \alpha \cdot E \left[X - \left(X \land \frac{d}{a} \right) \right] \\
    &= \alpha \cdot \left[E(X) - E \left(X \land \frac{d}{a} \right) \right] \\
    \\
    E \left(Y^P \right) &= \frac{E \left(Y^L \right)}{1 - F_{X} \left(\frac{d}{a} \right)}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to forget to **update the deductible to the new one** when using the complement of the CDF for the conversion between $Y^L$ and $Y^P$.

The key is understanding that **only amounts that the insured pays** is counted towards the deductible.

### **Bonus Incentive**

A **special combination** of a Deductible and Coinsurance is known as a **Bonus Incentive**.

Insurers usually provide incentives to their agents if the total losses for the year are **below some threshold**, where the incentive is some **percentage of the losses below this amount**.

Thus, the situation is similar to coinsurance applied after a deductible:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    B
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        \alpha \cdot (d - X),& X \lt d \\
        0,& X \ge d
    \end{cases} \\
    &= \alpha \cdot (d - X)_{+} \\
    \\
    \therefore E(B)
    &= E(d-X)_{+} \\
    &= E(d) - E(d \land X) \\
    &= E(d) - E(X \land d)
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Policy Limits**

The second type of policy modification is known as **Policy Limit**, denoted by $u$. It is the **maximum amount** that the insurer will payout.

* If $X$ is below the limit, then the insurer will **pay the loss**
* If $X$ is above the limit, then the insurer will only **pay the limit**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        X,& X \lt u \\
        u,& X \ge u
    \end{cases} \\
    &= X \land u \\
    \\
    E \left(Y^L \right) &= \int^{u}_{0} x \cdot f(x) + \int^{\infty}_{u} u \cdot f(x) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Under a deductible, $X \land d$ represents the **limited loss** of the *policyholder*.

    Under a policy limit, $x \land u$ represents the **limited payment** of the *insurer*.

Note that the expectation can be simplified using the **Survival Function Method** (FAM-L):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E \left(Y^L \right)
    &= \int^{u}_{0} x \cdot f(x) + \int^{\infty}_{u} u \cdot f(x) \\
    &= \left(\left[x \cdot (-S(x)) \right]^u_0 - \int^{u}_{0} (-S(x)) \cdot 1 \right) + u \cdot S(u) \\
    &= -u \cdot S(u) - 0 + \int^{u}_{0} S(x) + u \cdot S(u) \\
    &= \int^{u}_{0} S(x) dx
\end{aligned}
$$

Similar to the LER, insurers would like to find out **how much more** they have to pay if they were to increase the policy limit, measured through the **Increased Limit Factor** (ILF).

It is calculated as the **ratio** of the expected payment with the new limit $b$ to that of the current limit $u$:

$$
    \text{ILF} = \frac{E(X \land b)}{E(X \land u)}
$$

### **Limits & Deductibles**

Policy Limits on their own are a simple concept - the difficulty comes about when they are **mixed with deductibles**.

Consider the possible values of the payment variable:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& X \lt d \\
        X-d,& d \lt X \lt d + u \\
        u,& X \gt d + u
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

The key is understanding that **only what the insurer pays** is counted towards the limit - thus, the **effective limit** of the policy is $d + u$.

This is known as the **Maximum Covered Loss** $(m)$ which is the **smallest loss amount** at or above which the insurer will pay the policy limit. In other words, if $X \ge m$ then $Y^L = u$.

We can find an expression for payment by decomposing the piecewise function:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& X \lt d \\
        X-d,& d \lt X \lt d + u \\
        m - d,& X \gt d + u
    \end{cases} \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        X - X,& X \lt d \\
        X-d,& d \lt X \lt d + u \\
        m - d,& X \gt d + u
    \end{cases} \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        X,& X \lt d \\
        X,& d \lt X \lt d + u \\
        m,& X \gt d + u
    \end{cases}
    -
    \begin{cases}
        X,& X \lt d \\
        d,& d \lt X \lt d + u \\
        d,& X \gt d + u
    \end{cases} \\
    &= (X \land m) - (X \land d) \\
    \\
    \therefore E(Y^L) &= E(X \land m) - (X \land d)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    This is intuitive, as the amount paid is above the deductible $d$ but below the limit $m$.

### **Maximum Covered Loss**

The concept of maximum covered loss can be extended to **all combinations of modifications** involving a limit:

* **Policy Limit ONLY**: $m=u$
* **With Ordinary Deductible**: $m = u + d$
* **With Coinsurance**: $m = \frac{u}{\alpha}$
* **With BOTH Ordinary Deductible and Coinsurance**: $m = \frac{u}{\alpha} + d$

!!! Note

    For a franchise deductible, since the **full loss** is paid if the deductible has been met, $m=u$.

Thus, policy limits are more generally expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L_{\text{Policy Limit}}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        X,& X \lt m \\
        u,& X \ge m
    \end{cases} \\
    &= X \land m \\
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Inflation**

Although not technically a policy modification, **Inflation** is another factor that affects how the payments are calculated.

If the losses in the current year are $X$, then **losses in the FOLLOWING year** are expected to inflate by a factor of $r$, resulting in $(1+r)X$.

Since coinsurance is already a scaling of the loss random variable, adding an additional term for inflation does not impact much:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L_{\text{Coinsurance}} &= \alpha \cdot (1+r) \cdot X \\
    \therefore E \left(Y^L_{\text{Coinsurance}} \right)
    &= \alpha \cdot (1+r) \cdot E(X)
\end{aligned}
$$

However, policy limits involve a **minimum function**, which is more complicated to manipulate:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L_{\text{Policy Limit}}
    &= (1+r) \cdot X \land u \\
    &= (1+r) \left(X \land \frac{u}{1+r} \right) \\
    \therefore E \left(Y^L_{\text{Policy Limit}} \right)
    &= (1+r) \cdot E \left(X \land \frac{u}{1+r} \right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the same logic can be applied for deductibles with inflation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L_{\text{Deductible}}
    &= (1+r) \cdot X - (1+r) \cdot X \land d \\
    &= (1+r) \cdot X - (1+r) \cdot \left(X \land \frac{d}{1+r} \right) \\
    &= (1+r) \left[X - \left(X \land \frac{d}{1+r} \right) \right] \\
    \therefore E(Y^L_{\text{Deductible}})
    &= (1+r) \cdot E \left[X - \left(X \land \frac{d}{1+r} \right) \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    This is the **exact same result** as when coinsurance is applied before the deductible, as both involve scaling of $X$ without the deductible.

    Thus, remember to use the **updated deductible** when converting between $Y^L$ and $Y^P$.

An **alternative method** is available if the loss distribution is a **Scale Distribution**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    X &\sim \text{Scale Distribution}(\theta) \\
    X(1+r) &\sim \text{Scale Distribution}(\theta \cdot (1+r))
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, this allows us to **adjust the distribution rather than the function**.

## **All Modifications**

Consider a policy with all three policy modifications (with the coinsurance applied *after* the deductible):

1. **Below the deductible**, *nothing* will be paid
2. **Above the maximum covered loss**, the *policy limit* will be paid
3. **Between** these two values, the *coinsured portion of the excess loss* is paid

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& x \lt d \\
        \alpha (X-d),& d \lt X \lt m \\
        u,& X \ge m
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

This can then be simplified to yield the following results:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& X \le d \\
        \alpha(X-d),& d \lt X \lt m \\
        u,& X \ge m
    \end{cases} \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        \alpha (X-X),& X \le d \\
        \alpha \cdot (X-d),& d \lt X \lt m \\
        \alpha (m-d),& X \ge m
    \end{cases} \\
    &= \alpha \cdot
    \begin{cases}
        X-X,& X \le d \\
        X-d,& d \lt X \lt m \\
        m-d,& X \ge m
    \end{cases} \\
    &= \alpha \cdot
    \left [
    \begin{cases}
        X,& X \le d \\
        X,& d \lt X \lt m \\
        m,& X \ge m
    \end{cases} -
    \begin{cases}
        X,& X \le d \\
        d,& d \lt X \lt m \\
        d,& X \ge m
    \end{cases}
    \right] \\
    &= \alpha \cdot \left[(X \land m) - (X \land d) \right] \\
    \\
    E \left(Y^L \right)
    &= \alpha \cdot E \left[(X \land m) - (X \land d) \right] \\
    &= \alpha \cdot \left (E \left[(X \land m) \right] - E \left[(X \land d) \right] \right) \\
    \\
    E \left(Y^P \right) &= \frac{E \left(Y^L \right)}{1 - F_{X}(d)}
\end{aligned}
$$

If **inflation** is considered, then the above can be easily adjusted for the following year:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E \left(Y^L \right)
    &= \alpha (1+r) \cdot \left (E \left[\left(X \land \frac{m}{1+r}\right) \right] - E \left[\left(X \land \frac{d}{1+r} \right) \right] \right) \\
    \\
    E \left(Y^P \right) &= \frac{E \left(Y^L \right)}{1 - F_{X} \left(\frac{d}{1+r} \right)}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Hybrid Modification**

There may be policies that contain an unusual combination of features. The only way to solve them is by **first principles**. Consider the **overall piecewise function and then split them** into more recognisable ones, using the "tricks" shown above.

Consider a two deductible example from **SOA Sample Question #60**:

<!-- Obtained from SOA -->
![Hybrid Modification](Assets/4.%20Policy%20Modifications.md/Hybrid%20Modification.png){.center}

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y^L
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& X \lt 1000 \\
        0.8 \cdot (X - 1000),& 1000 \lt X \lt 6000 \\
        0.8 \cdot (6000 - 1000),& 6000 \lt X \lt 14000 \\
        0.8 \cdot (6000 - 1000) + 0.9 \cdot (X - 14000),& X \gt 14000
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

The tricky part about forming this function is the third level:

* Since the policyholder bears the full cost of the repairs, the insurer **does not pay anything new**; they pay the **maximum amount of the previous level**.
* The policyholder has **paid 1000 from the deductible** and **1000 from the coinsurance**, thus has to bear 8000 of losses themselves, resulting in an **upper limit of 14000**.


Using the methods shown earlier, it can be split into the following components:

!!! Tip

    For any question involving complicated tiers of payments, it is best to **write out the piecewise function** and manipulate it like above.

    The **key manipulation** is $0 = X - X$, allowing certain piecewise functions to be collapsed into $E(X)$ or $(X \land d)$.
