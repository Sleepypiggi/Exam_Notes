# **Short Term Insurance**

## **General Insurance**

### **Automobile Insurance**

### **Homeowners Insurance**

They typically have a **Coinsurance Provision** that penalizes the insured for **under-insuring** their house.

!!! Warning

    This is a completely different concept from a regular Coinsurance modification -- do not confuse the two.

If the chosen **sum insured $(I)$ is less than some proportion of the value of the house** $(cF)$, then the benefit paid out is **scaled down by that proportion**.

!!! Note

    If the sum insured is equal or more than the coinsurance provision, the benefit **does not scale up**. It is meant to be only a penalty.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        \min (I, \frac{I}{cF} \cdot L),& I \lt cF \\
        \min(I, L),& I \lt cF
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

The coinsurance provision only affects the "raw" benefits. If the penalized loss **still exceeds the insured amount**, then only the insured amount will be paid.

### **Major Medical**

### **Dental Insurance**

Unlike major medical, **Dental Insurance** is typically part of **Group Insurance**.

The main purpose of insurance is to **share large infrequent costs** among a large number of policyholders. However, dental costs are usually small and frequent, thus there is little value in individual dental insurance. 

There are four types of dental coverage:

* I, **Diagnostic & Preventive**: Oral Examinations & Cleaning
* II, **Basic Services**: Extraction & Resotration
* III, **Prostethics**: Crowns & Inlays
* IV, **Orthodontia**: Braces & Retainers

## **Reinsurance**

Insurers can also purchase insurance for themselves, known as **Reinsurance**.

Reinsurers can also purchase insurance for themselves, known as **Retrocession**.

!!! Info

    This process of an insurer buying insurance for themselves is known as **Ceding** their risk to another insurer.

    Thus, a reinsurer passing on the ceded risk to another is known as **Retroceding**.

There are two broad ways that reinsurance can be categorised.

The **first way** that they can be categorised are based on **which risks** are ceded under the reinsurance:

* **Treaty** - All risks under a line of business
* **Facultative** - Specific risks chosen by the reinsurer

The second category is based on **how much** of these risks are covered -- **Proportional** or **Excess of Loss**, which will be covered in the following two sections.

### **Proportional Reinsurance**

As its name suggests, proportional reinsurance provides coverage for losses in a **fixed proportion**.

The most basic form is known as **Quota Share**, where the insurer and reinsurer share a **proportion of total risk** $(\alpha)$. For instance, the insurer may pay 30% of losses while the reinsurer covers the remaining 70%.

Questions can also ask for the **expected payment of either the insurer or reinsurer**, which can be found mathematically if given the severity distribution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y_{\text{Insurer}} = (1-\alpha) \cdot X \\
    \\
    Y_{\text{Reinsurer}} = \alpha \cdot X
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Some questions may not be very explicit about the proportions. Thus, if only **one percentage** is mentioned, then it is assumed to be the **reinsurer's portion**.

    For instance, "70% Quota Share" means that the reinsurer covers 70% of losses.

The other form is known as **Surplus Share**. The insurer covers **100% of the losses up till a certain threshold**, known as the **Retention Limit** $(\delta)$. **Above this level**, the insurer and reinsurer share the cost in some proportion **like a quota share**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y_{\text{Insurer}}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        X,& X \lt \delta \\
        (1-\alpha) \cdot (X - \delta) + \delta,& X \lt \delta \\
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    Y_{\text{Reinsurer}}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& X \lt \delta \\
        \alpha \cdot (X - \delta),& X \lt \delta \\
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

The sharing can also come in **multiple layers**, where the amount shared

* **Retention Limit**: $1,000,000
* **Layer 1**: 70% of $500,000 in excess of $1,000,000
* **Layer 2**: 80% of $500,000 in excess of $1,500,000
* **Layer 3**: 90% in excess of $2,000,000

### **Excess of Loss**

**Excess of Loss** (XOL) reinsurance provides coverage for the insurer past a certain threshold.

In its simplest form, it can be thought of as a Surplus Share where the reinsurer **covers 100% of the costs** past the retention limit.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Y_{\text{Insurer}}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        X,& X \lt \delta \\
        \delta,& X \lt \delta \\
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    Y_{\text{Reinsurer}}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& X \lt \delta \\
        X - \delta,& X \lt \delta \\
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    This is **functionally the same as a deductible** that is applied to primary policies.

There are three different types of XOL reinsurance, based on how the losses are computed:

* **Per Risk**: Covers the losses on **one policy**
* **Per Occurrence**: Covers the losses from **one occurrence** that impacts **multiple policies** (EG. Earthquake)
* **Aggregate Loss**: Covers ALL the losses within a specified period

!!! Note

    When applied on aggregate losses, it is usually referred to as a **Stop Loss Reinsurance**, as it **limits the losses** of the insurer to just the retention amount.
