# **Model Estimation**

This section assumes some basic knowledge on **Maximum Likelihood Estimation** (MLE), which can be found under another set of notes covering a [Review of Statistical Theory](../../3. Predictive Analytics/ASA-SRM/Review of Statistical Theory.md).

## **Motivation**

Rather than making an assumption about the distribution of frequency or losses or their parameters, we can **study the raw data directly** to gain a better understanding of it.

However, there are several key data-related concepts that must be covered.

## **Complete Data**

If given a full dataset where the value of each observation is known, then it is a complete dataset. Distribution parameters can be estimated normally through MLE.

For complete data only, the MOM shortcut can be used for the following distributions:

* (a, b, 0) distributions
* Normal family distributions
* Exponetial family distributions

Notice that all of the (a, b, 0) distributions are listed. Thus, their **zero-modified counterparts** can also be found using the shortcut:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E \left(X^M \right)
    &= \frac{1 - p^{m}_{0}}{1 - p_{0}} \cdot E(X) \\
    &= \frac{1 - p^{m}_{0}}{1 - p_{0}} \cdot \bar{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Incomplete Data**

In practice, insurers often work with **incomplete data**, where they **do not have the exact values** of observations or only have a **partial dataset**.

### **Truncated**

The first type of incomplete data is known as **Truncated Data**. It means that the dataset **does not include** observations past a specified threshold.

<center>

| Left Truncation | Right Truncation |
| :-: | :-: |
| Truncated from below | Truncated from above |
| Lower Threshold | Upper Threshold |
| No values below $d$ | No values above $u$ |

</center>

The most common case would be **Left Truncated** data, which occurs when the policy has a **Deductible**.

This is because when the loss amount does not need meet the deductible, policyholders **would not bother to report** it. Thus, the insurer **only receives loss amounts that exceed the deductible**.

!!! Warning

    The notation for the threshold is $d$ to denote deductible. HOWEVER, the notation $u$ here DOES NOT represent policy limits!

In terms of MLE, this means that the **ENTIRE distribution is conditioned** on having values above $d$ or below $u$. Thus, the likelihood functions should be constructed using **conditional PMFs/PDFs** of **EVERY observation**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P_{\theta} (X = x \mid X \gt d) &= \frac{P_{\theta}(X = x)}{P(X \gt d)} \\
    \\
    \therefore L^{LT}(\theta)
    &= \prod P_{\theta} (X = x \mid X \gt d) \\
    &= \prod \frac{P_{\theta}(X = x)}{P(X \gt d)} \\
    &= \frac{1}{[P(X \gt d)]^n} \cdot \prod P_{\theta}(X = x) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

#### **Losses VS Payments**

Recall that for a deductible, there is a clear **distinction between Ground Up Losses and Claim Payments**.

$$
    \text{Payment} = \text{Ground Up Loss} - \text{Deductible}
$$

The data provided could be **either payments or losses**, and the distribution fitted could either be for the payments or losses.

If the data and the distribution are different, then the above adjustment needs to be made for every observation.

!!! Warning

    The terminology used in these types of questions tend to be slightly ambiguous.

    If the question only uses "claims", then it should be intepreted as losses.

    In other words, **unless "payments" are EXPLICITLY mentioned**, it should be intepreted as losses.

#### **Memoryless Distribution**

If the distribution being fitted is memoryless, then the **method of moments** can be used even for truncated data.

Loss data is truncated at the deductible. If converted to payment data using the above method, then the converted data is NOT truncated. Thus, the MOM can be used to **easily fit a distribution to the payment data**.

The issue is that the **distribution is fitted to the losses, not the payments**. However, if the loss distribution is memoryless, then the payments will follow the same distribution and thus the MOM can be used.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    X &\sim \text{Exponential}(\theta) \\
    X - d &\sim \text{Exponential}(\theta)
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Censored**

The second type of incomplete data is known as **Censored Data**. It means that **exact values of certain observations** are not known.

<center>

| Left Censored | Right Censored |
| :-: | :-: |
| Censored from below | Censored from above |
| Values **at most** $d$; record as $d$ | Values **at least** $u$; record as $u$ |

![Censored Data](Assets/8.%20Model%20Estimation.md/Censored%20Data.png){.center}

The most common case would be **Right Censored** data, which occurs when the policy has a **Policy Limit**.

This is because when the policyholder submits a claim, they will only **submit up to the amount that the limit covers**, even when the actual loss exceeds that amount. Thus, insurers will **only receive loss amounts at the limit**.

!!! Warning

    Similar to the warning from before, the notation for the threshold is $u$ to denote policy limit. HOWEVER, the notation $d$ here DOES NOT represent deductibles!

    $u$ and $d$ are still used in order to be consistent and ease understanding.

In terms of MLE, this means that the **likelihoods of censored observations are incorrect**. Instead of the PMF/PDF, they should be represented by the **probability that they are larger/smaller than the threshold**.

Thus, for censored observations at the threshold, the updated likelihoods must be used:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(X = x_{\text{Censored}}) &= P(X \gt u) \\
    \\
    \therefore L^{RC}(\theta)
    &= \prod P_{\theta} (X = x_{\text{Not Censored}}) \cdot \prod P(X = x_{\text{Censored}})
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Unlike truncation which affects every observation, censoring only affects **certain observations**.

    Similarly, **each observation is affected differently**, unlike truncation where they are affected the same way.

### **Grouped**

The last type of incomplete data is known as **Grouped Data**. Similar to censoring, the exact values of *ALL* observations are not known. Instead, they are presented as the number of observations in a **distinct interval**.

!!! Tip

    Ranges are concisely expressed using the **bracket notation** - () denotes that the bound is exlcusive while [] denotes that it is inclusive. For instance, (15, 20] denoted that the amount is **strictly larger** than 15 but **less than or equal** to 20; $15 \lt 5 \le 20$.

![Grouped Data](Assets/8.%20Model%20Estimation.md/Grouped%20Data.png){.center}

In terms of MLE, the likelihood of an observation within this range is simply the **difference of the CDFs** at the end and beginning of the interval:

$$
    P_{\theta}(a \le X \le b) = P_{\theta}(X \le b) - P_{\theta}(X \le a)
$$

For a discrete distribution, this can be simplified to the sum of PMFs at each value:

$$
    P_{\theta}(a \le X \le b) = P_{\theta}(X = a) + \dots + P_{\theta}(X = b)
$$

!!! Tip

    Some questions may provide a seemingly "wrong" range

    For instance, in the following SOA Sample Question, the group starts from 0, but the lower bound of the distribution is $\theta$:

    <!-- Obtained from SOA FAM-S Sample -->
    ![Grouped Tip](Assets/8.%20Model%20Estimation.md/Grouped%20Tip.png)

    The trick is to simply change the upper/lower bound of the group to **match the distribution**.
