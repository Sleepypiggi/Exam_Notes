# **Loss Reserving**

## **Overview**

General Insurance claims may be filed **long after** the loss event occurs, thus they must set up a **Loss Reserve** to ensure that they have enough capital to pay out these claims well into the future.

## **Loss Terminology**

This subsection will properly introduce the proper terminology regarding losses

There are three basic building blocks of a reported claim:

* **Incurred Losses**: **Reported** loss amount
* **Paid Losses**: Loss amounts that have been **reported and paid out**
* **Case Reserve**: Loss amounts that have been **reported but not yet paid out**

$$
    \text{Incurred Loss} = \text{Paid Loss} + \text{Case Reserve}
$$

The problem is that there will always be losses stemming from accidents that occurred in the past that have **yet to be reported** to the insurer, appropriately named as **Incurred But Not Reported** (IBNR) losses.

The main objective of loss reserving is to estimate this quantity by **predicting how losses will grow** over time thus ensuring that they have enough capital to cover it via an **IBNR Reserve**.

This process of predicting how losses will grow is known as **Loss Development**. The **final loss amount** is known as the **Ultimate Loss**, from which **no further development** will occur.

The **difference** between the final loss (**ultimate**) and what has been reported (**incurred**) is the IBNR reserve as of the current time:

$$
    \text{IBNR Reserve} = \text{Ultimate Loss} - \text{Incurred Loss}
$$

Thus, the total loss reserve is thus the **combination of the two reserves**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Loss Reserve}
    &= \text{Case Reserve} + \text{IBNR Reserve} \\
    &= \text{Ultimate Loss} - \text{Incurred Loss} + \text{Case Reserve} \\
    &=  \text{Ultimate Loss} - \text{Paid Loss}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Intuitively, the total reserve is simply the difference between the ultimate loss and what has been paid, as the total reserve is meant to **cover all unpaid losses**.

## **Expected Loss Ratio Method**

The **simplest method** for estimating ultimate losses is known as the **Expected Loss Ratio Method**.

**Loss Ratios** (LR) are the **ratio of losses to premiums**, which is a measure of the **percentage of premiums** that have been used to pay losses.

$$
    \text{LR} = \frac{\text{Loss}}{\text{Premium}}
$$

The **Expected Loss Ratio** (ELR) is the **ultimate loss ratio**; the ratio of the **ultimate loss to aggregate premiums** collected over the life of the policy.

Since **premiums are known** by the insurer, this can be used to obtain an estimate for the ultimate loss:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{ELR} &= \frac{\text{Ultimate Loss}}{\text{Total Premium}} \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{Ultimate Loss} &= \text{Earned Premium} \cdot \text{ELR}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Chain Ladder Method**

Another method of estimating ultimate losses is known as the **Chain Ladder** (CL) Method.

This methods works by finding **patterns in historical loss development** and assumes that future losses will **continue to develop in a similar manner**.

In order to efficiently find patterns in historical losses, they are recorded in a convenient format known as a **Development Table**:

* **Each Cell** represents the **paid losses** in that year
* **Each Row** shows losses that occurred in the **same Accident Year** (AY)
* **Each Column** shows losses that occurred in the **same Development Year** (DY)
* **Each Diagonal** shows losses that occurred in the **same Calendar Year** (CY)

!!! Note

    The AY that the diagonal originates from is the CY for that calendar year. This can be seen by the colouring of the cells in the table below.

    The definition for AY and CY can be found in the ratemaking section.s

DYs are also known as the **age of the claim** as they indicate how long after the AY when the claims are paid. For instance, DY3 represents that the claim was paid 3 years after the AY.

The next step is to find the **Cumulative paid Losses** per AY. This is done by changing the values of each cell to the **sum of all previous cells in the same row**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Cumulative Loss} &= \text{Sum of Losses in the same AY} \\
    \text{Cumulative Cell}_{\text{AY, DY}} &= \sum_{DY} \text{Cell}_{\text{AY, DY}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Some questions may **directly provide the cumulative losses** in the table rather than incremental losses, saving you the time of having to sum everything up.

The **number of columns** indicates how long the insurer expects the losses to develop for. If the last column is DY6, then the **cumulative loss at DY6 is the ultimate loss**. 

!!! Warning

    Some questions will require us to construct our own table. Thus, it is important to fully **understand the intuition** behind it.

    The key idea under the CL method is that losses all take the **same duration** to develop to their ultimate values.

    This means that the losses occurring in different years will take the **same duration to mature at different dates**. It is an extremely common mistake to think that all the losses develop to ultimate on the same date.

    Thus, the DYs can be thought of as the **age of the losses**. Losses from later AYs are **"younger" and hence need more time to mature**.

![Cumulative Development Tables](Assets/6.%20Loss%20Reserving.md/Cumulative%20Development%20Table.png){.center}

!!! Tip

    Instead of Development Year, some questions may use the term **Calendar Year** (CY). As will be mentioned in the ratemaking chapter, **CY and AY are assumed to be synonmous** for the purposes of losses.

    The difference between the CY and the AY is the development year. For instance, if the **cumulative losses at CY7** are given for **AY5 losses**, then the losses are at **DY2**.

The goal is now to find the **historical patterns** in the losses and then use those patterns to fill up the blank half of the development table.

The historical patterns are known as **Loss Development Factors** (LDF), which is the **ratio of the current DY's cumulative loss to the previous DY's cumulative loss**:

$$
    \text{LDF}_{\text{AY, DY}} = \frac{\text{Cumulative Cell}_{\text{AY, DY}}}{\text{Cumulative Cell}_{\text{AY, DY}-1}}
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![LDF Development Table](Assets/6.%20Loss%20Reserving.md/LDF%20Development%20Table.png){.center}

The next step would be to **develop each years using the development factors**, until it reaches the ultimate loss:

$$
    \text{Cumulative Cells}_{\text{AY, DY}+1} = \text{Cumulative Cells}_{\text{AY, DY}} \cdot \text{LDF}_{\text{AY, DY}}
$$

However, the problem is that for all years other than the final year, there are usually **multiple LDFs** for each DY. Questions will usually specify to either the arithmetic average, recent average of weighted average.

For simplicity, we assume that the **arithmetic average** is used. We will arrive at the following LDFs and thus the corresponding **final development table**:

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Reserve Development Table](Assets/6.%20Loss%20Reserving.md/Reserve%20Development%20Table.png){.center}

$$
    \text{Ultimate Loss}
    = \text{Paid Loss} \cdot \text{LDF}_{\text{DY}} \cdot \text{LDF}_{\text{DY}+1} \cdot \text{LDF}_{\text{DY}+2} \cdot \dots
$$

!!! Tip

    Instead of slowly multiplying each years LDF, we can instead combine them such into an **Age to Ultimate** LDF which brings a loss from a **specified age to its ultimate value**:

    $$
        \text{LDF}_{\text{Age to Ult}}
        = \prod^{\text{Ultimate DY}}_{\text{Current DY}}
        \text{LDF}_{\text{DY}}
    $$

    Thus, given the **age to ult for two consecutive ages**, we can find the LDF at the age:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \frac{\text{LDF}_{2, \text{Ult}}}{\text{LDF}_{3, \text{Ult}}}
        &= \frac{f_{2} \cdot f_{3} \cdot f_{4} \cdot \dots}{f_{3} \cdot f_{4} \cdot \dots} \\
        &= f_{2}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

Although all the examples used Paid Losses, the CL method can also use **Reported Losses**. It will still result in the **same ultimate loss**.

## **Bornhautter Ferguson Method**

The last method is known as the **Bornhautter Ferguson** (BF) method, which is a combination of the above two methods.

Consider the loss reserve under the CL method:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Loss Reserve}
    &= \text{Ultimate Loss} - \text{Paid Loss} \\
    &= \text{Ultimate Loss} - \frac{\text{Ultimate Loss}}{\text{LDF}_\text{Ultimate}} \\
    &= \text{Ultimate Loss} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{\text{LDF}_\text{Ultimate}} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Instead of providing the LDFs, questions may sometimes use the following terminology:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{Percentage of Paid Losses} &= \frac{1}{\text{LDF}_\text{Ultimate}} \\
        \text{Percentage of Unpaid Losses} &= 1 - \frac{1}{\text{LDF}_\text{Ultimate}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

By using the **Ultimate Loss from the ELR method**, the two methods are combined, resulting in the **BF reserves**:

$$
    \text{Loss Reserve}_{\text{BF}}
    = \text{Ultimate Loss}_{\text{ELR}}
    \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{\text{LDF}_{\text{CL, Ultimate}}} \right)
$$

Unlike the previous two methods, the BF method **directly estimates the loss reserves**, not the Ultimate Losses.

!!! Warning

    It is an **extremely common mistake** to think that the BF Ultimate Loss is the ELR Ultimate Loss, because it was what is used in the equation.

    $$
        \text{Ultimate Loss}_{\text{BF}} \ne \text{Ultimate Loss}_{\text{ELR}}
    $$

    Since the BF method directly estimates the loss reserves, the ultimate losses must be determined from **first principles**:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{Ultimate Loss}_{\text{BF}} = \text{Loss Reserve}_{\text{BF}} + \text{Paid Loss} \\
    \end{aligned}
    $$

### **Weighted Average Method**

Alternatively, the BF method method can be calculated as the **weighted average of the two methods**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Loss Reserve}_{BF}
    &= w \cdot \text{Loss Reserve}_{CL} + (1-w) \cdot \text{Loss Reserve}_{ELR} \\
    w &= \frac{1}{\text{LDF}_{\text{CL, Ultimate}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    The above applies **DOES NOT** apply to the IBNR reserve!

The intuition is that as the losses mature, their LDF factors decrease. This cases the weight given to the **CL method to increase**. This is intuitive, as more data is available for those claims, and thus **more weight should be given to the method that uses claims experience**.

One key result is that the BF reserve is always calculated **between the other two reserves**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{ELR Loss Reserve} \lt \text{BF Loss Reserve} \lt \text{CL Loss Reserve} \\
    \text{ELR Loss Reserve} \gt \text{BF Loss Reserve} \gt \text{CL Loss Reserve}
\end{aligned}
$$

There is no strict relationship as to which is larger or smaller; just that the BF method is in between.

## **Reserve Calculation**

Using the ultimate loss from the first two methods, the reserve for each year can be calculated. It can be used to calculate **either the IBNR or Total Reserve**, depending on what is subtracted from the ultimate:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Loss Reserve} &= \text{Ultimate Loss} - \text{Paid Loss} \\
    \text{IBNR Reserve} &= \text{Ultimate Loss} - \text{Reported Loss}
\end{aligned}
$$

For all three methods, the total reserve held by the insurer is the **sum of the reserves for each accident year**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Total Loss Reserve} &= \sum \text{Loss Reserve}_\text{AY} \\
    \text{Total IBNR Reserve} &= \sum \text{IBNR Reserve}_\text{AY}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the phrasing is very explicit -- "total" reserve implies that there is a reserve for more than one year.

!!! Note

    Other than accident year, losses can also be aggregated or categorized based on other factors such as **line of business**.

    Regardless, the concept remains the same -- the total reserve held is the sum of reserves for all blocks of business.

Given the ultimate loss in one year, the ultimate loss in another year can be **"roughly" estimated** by considering the growth of the business each year:

$$
    \text{Ultimate Loss}_{t}
    = \text{Ultimate Loss} \cdot (\text{Inflation})^{t} \cdot (\text{Business Growth})^{t}
$$

Naturally, this method should only be used when there are **no other options available**.
