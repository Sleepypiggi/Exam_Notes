# **Introduction to Statistical Learning**

## **Estimation VS Prediction**

The primary focus of traditional statistics lies in **Estimation**. However, the focus of statistical learning is **Prediction**. Both are **approximation methods** and although they are used interhchangeably in layman terms, there is a **technical difference** between the two:

|                 Non-stochastic                  |                    Stochastic                     |

## **Key Elements**


Predictor comes with additional uncertaitnty due to the stochastic nature (on top of uncertaintity in the estimation parameters)
EVen with increasing sample size, the prediction does not shrink to 0 (Irreducible randomness)
