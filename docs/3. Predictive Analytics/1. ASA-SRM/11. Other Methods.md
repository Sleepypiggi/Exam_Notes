# **Other Methods**

This section covers other methods that do not fit well with the theme of the other chapters.

## **K-Nearest Neighbours**

**K-Nearest Neighbours** (KNN) is non-parametric method that can be used in a regression or classification setting:

1. Identify the observation in vector space
2. Identify the $k$ **nearest observations** (based on Euclidean Distance)
3. Take the average of the observations in (2) as the prediction (regression) or the most frequent category among them (classification)

$k$ is a measure of **flexibility** - it should not be too large such that observations that are not closely related are used, but it cannot be too small such that it fails to capture the signal.

!!! Warning

    Do not confuse K-means clustering and K-Nearest Neighbours! Both contain $k$ but have very different functions.
