# **Principal Component Analysis**

## **Overview**

As alluded to over the course of the notes, datasets with a large numebr of variables tend to have problems such as Curse of Dimensionality and Multicollinearity, among others.

**Principal Component Analaysis** (PCA) is an unsupervised statistical learning method that transforms high dimensional data into a **lower dimensional space** by creating **new key variables** ("Principal Components") that are **linear combinations** of the other variables.
