# **Life Assurances**

## **Overview**

Life Assurances are contracts that promise to pay out a benefit $B$ on either the **death or survival** of the policyholder.

The value of a life assurance must reflect these two aspects:

1. **Uncertainty of payments** - **Expected Value**, based on Survival Models
2. **Time value of money** - **Present Value**, based on Interest Theory

Thus, the value of a life assurance is best quantified through the **Expected Present Value** (EPV) of the promised payouts.

## **Payable Discretely**

The simplest form of life assurance pays the benefits at the **end of the year** that the insured event occurs.

Since we are only concerned with the status of the insured at **discrete integer ages**, $K_x$ is used as the survival model.

Let $Z$ be the **random variable** denoting **present value** of the benefit payable:

$$
    Z = B \cdot v^{K_x + 1}
$$

Thus, the EPV is the **expectation of $Z$**; it is the **sumproduct** of ALL possible present values and their associated probabilities:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV} &= \sum B \cdot v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + k} \\
    E(Z) &= \sum B \cdot v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k \mid}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The associated probability is the probability of dying in each period, **given that they survived till that period**. It is essentially the **deferred probability of death** for each period.

For simplicity, the benefits are usually **assumed to be 1** ($B = 1$). This allows the EPVs to be easily **scaled for any level of $B$** required.

### **Actuarial Notation**

Similar to the survival model, given how often these values are calculated, they are abbreviated using the **International Actuarial Notation** as well.

$A$ represents the **first moment** (expectation) of the **present value** of a contract where a **benefit of 1** is payable discretely.

The subscript $x$ represents the **age** of the policyholder while the additional subscript $:\enclose{actuarial}{n}$ represents the **duration** the contract.

!!! Note

    To be more precise, the above subscripts are known as a **Status**. They indicate whether a certain **condition is fulfulled**:

    * $x$ is known as the **Life Status** which is **active as long as they are alive** and **fails when they die**.

    * $n$ is known as the **Duration Status** which is **active during the term** and **fails when the term is finished**.

    * $A$ is an assurance that pays benefits upon the **failure of the contract's status**.

    Thus, $T_{x}$ more generally measures the time to failure of an entity.

    If a contract has multiple statuses, then the overall status **fails as long as one of the underlying statuses fails**.

    However, if the **order** of the failure matters, then a $1$ can be placed **above a particular status** to indicate that the overall status only fails if that status **fails FIRST**.

Thus, putting everything together, the EPV of each assurance can be denoted as follows:

* **Whole Life Assurance** - Payable whenever policyholder dies; $A_x$
* **Term Assurance** - Payable only if policyholder dies during assurance period; $A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Pure Endowment** - Payable only if policyholder survives past assurance period; $A^{\>\>\> 1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Endowment Assurance** - Payable whichever of the above two occur first; $A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$
* **Deferred Whole Life Assurance** - Payable only if policyholder dies after $n$ years; ${}_{n|}A_x$

!!! Tip

    **Pure Endowments** can also be expressed as ${}_{n}E_x$ for easier typesetting and is the method that SOA usually uses to denote PEs.

### **Whole Life Assurance**

**Whole Life Assurances** cover the insured **indefinitely** and thus *will* pay out *whenever* the insured dies.

Let **WL** be the RV denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
    \text{WL} = v^{K_x + 1}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![WL Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/WL%20Discrete.png){.center}

Thus, its EPV can be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{WL}) &= \sum^\infty_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    A_{x} &= \sum^\infty_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Another commonly used metric is its **Variance**. In order to get it, the **Second Moment** must first be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{WL}}^2)
    &= \sum^\infty_{k = 0} \left(v^{k + 1}\right)^2 \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    &= \sum^\infty_{k = 0} \left[(v^2)^{k + 1} \right] \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the expression can be simplified to a form that looks **almost identical to the first moment** - with the only difference being that is uses $v^2$ instead of $v$.

Thus, the second moment is simply the first moment **evaluated at a higher interest rate** $i^*=(1+i)^2-1$, such that $v^* = v^2$.

!!! Tip

    Using **actuarial notation**, it is denoted as ${}^{2}A_x$, where $2$ is known as the **multiplier on the interest rate** used to evaluate the moment, $i^*=(1+i)^2-1$.
    
    It can also be more **generally denoted** as $\left. A_x \right|_{i = (1+i)^2-1}$, which will come in handy for more complicated expressions.

The **Second Moment** and hence **Variance** can be shown as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E({\text{WL}}^2) &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^2)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    {}^{2} A_{x} &= \sum^\infty_{K_x = 0} (v^*)^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{WL}) &= {}^{2} A_{x} - (A_{x})^2
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    In practice, we have to **scale the EPV/Variance** accordingly based on the actual benefit:
    
    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{Actual PV} &= B \cdot WL \\
        \\
        \text{Actual EPV}
        &= E(B \cdot \text{WL}) \\
        &= B \cdot E(\text{WL}) \\
        \\
        \text{Actual Second Moment}
        &= E(B^2 \cdot \text{WL}^2) \\
        &= B^2 \cdot E(\text{WL}^2) \\
        \\
        \text{Actual Variance}
        &= \text{Var}(B \cdot \text{WL}) \\
        &= B^2 \cdot \text{Var}(\text{WL})
    \end{aligned}
    $$
    
    This may lead to an **extremely large value for the variance**, thus do not be alarmed when performing such calculations.

### **Term Assurance**

**Term Assurance** covers the insured for a **specified period $n$** and only pays out *if* the insured dies within that period. **NOTHING** is paid out if the insured *survives beyond* that.

Let **TA** be the RV denoting the PV of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{TA} &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        0 ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= {}_{\{K_x \le n-1\}} v^{K_x+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

$\{K_x \le n-1\}$ is known as an **Indicator Function**, which is a binary variable that takes **1 if the condition is true and 0 if the condition if false**. It provides a concise way to express a piecewise function in a single expression.

<!-- Self Made -->
![TA Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/TA%20Discrete.png)

Thus, the EPV and Variance can be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{TA}) &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + 0 \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    \\
    E({\text{TA}}^2) &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} (v^2)^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + 0^2 \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \sum^\infty_{k = 0} (v^2)^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{TA}) &= {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - (A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Pure Endowment**

**Pure Endowments** are a special kind of contract that instead only pays out *if* the insured **survives** past a specified period $n$. **NOTHING** is paid out if the insured *dies before* that.

Let **PE** be the **RV** denoting the PV of the *survival* benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{PE} &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 ,& K_x = 0, 1, 2 \dots, n \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Unlike the other assurances, the discounting factor for PE **does NOT depend on $K_x$** because it is **paid out at a fixed time at maturity**. No matter how long the policyholder survives past maturity, they are ONLY going to receive that amount.

<!-- Self Made -->
![PE Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/PE%20Discrete.png){.center}

Thus, the EPV and Variance can be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{PE}) &= 0 \cdot {}_{n}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}_{n}E_x &= v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    \\
    E({\text{PE}}^2) &= 0^2 \cdot {}_{n}q_{x} + (v^2)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}^{2}_{n}E_x &= (v^*)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{PE}) &= {}^{2}_{n}E_x - ({}_{n}E_x)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Note that unlike all other assurances, a summation was not involved, since the values do not depend on $K_x$.

    The probability of receiving the payout is simply the *single probability* of surviving till maturity, since it **does not matter what happens after that**.

Since both discount factors and survival probabilities follow the **multiplication rule**, PEs follow them as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    v^{m+n} &= v^{m} \cdot v^{n} \\
    {}_{n+m}p_{x} &= {}_{m}p_{x} \cdot {}_{n}p_{x+m} \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{n+m}E_{x}
    &= v^{m+n} \cdot {}_{n+m}p_{x}\\
    &= (v^{m} \cdot {}_{m}p_{x}) \cdot (v^{n} \cdot {}_{n}p_{x+m}) \\
    &= {}_{m}E_{x} \cdot {}_{n}E_{x+m}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    This allows us to use the table values for a wide range of PEs, reducing the chance of miscalculation:

    $$
        {}_{30}E_{x} = {}_{20}E_{x} \cdot {}_{10}E_{x+20}
    $$

    However, special care must be taken to ensure that the age in the second term is updated.

### **Endowment Assurance**

**Endowment Assurances** are a *combination* of term assurances and pure endowments:

* **Term Assurance** - Pays out if the insured dies within the period
* **Pure Endowment** - Pays out if the insured survives past the period
* Thus, endowment assurances WILL pay out in a relatively shorter time compared to WL

Let **EA** be the RV denoting the PV of its benefits:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EA}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x = 0, 1, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^n ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= v^{\min(K_x + 1, n)}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![EA Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/EA%20Discrete.png){.center}

Thus, the EPV and Variance can be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{EA}) &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}E_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    The SULT table provides values for the EPVs EA and PE with terms of 10 or 20 years. Thus, the **difference** of these values can also be used to calculate the **EPV of a TA with a term of 10 or 20 years**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{EA}^2) &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} (v^2)^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + (v^2)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    {}^{2} A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} (v^*)^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + (v^*)^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}^{2}_{n}E_x \\
    \\
    \therefore Var(\text{EA})
    &= {}^{2} A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - \left(A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\right)^2 \\
    &= \left({}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}^{2}_{n}E_x \right) - \left(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - ({}_{n}E_x) \right)^2 \\
    &= \left({}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}^{2}_{n}E_x \right) - \left[(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2 + 2(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \cdot {}_{n}E_x) + ({}_{n}E_x)^2 \right] \\
    &= {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - (A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2 + {}^{2}_{n}E_x - ({}_{n}E_x)^2 - 2(A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \cdot {}_{n}E_x)\\
    &= \text{Var (TA)} + \text{Var (PE)} - 2 \cdot E(\text{TA}) \cdot E(\text{PE})
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is an extremely common mistake to think that the variance is the combination of the two variances:

    $$
        \text{Var(EA)} \ne \text{Var(TA)} + \text{Var(PE)}
    $$

    This is because the Covariance needs to be accounted for:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{Var(EA)}
        &= \text{Var (TA + PE)} \\
        &= \text{Var (TA)} + \text{Var (PE)} + 2 \cdot \text{Cov(TA, PE)}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Another common mistake comes from *thinking* that they are independent, because they seem to be unrelated:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{Cov(TA, PE)}
        &= E(\text{TA, PE}) - E(\text{TA}) \cdot E(\text{PE}) \\
        \\
        TA \cdot PE
        &=
        \begin{cases}
            v^{K_x + 1} \cdot 0, K_x \lt n \\
            0 \cdot v^n, K_x \ge n
        \end{cases} \\
        &=
        \begin{cases}
            0, K_x \lt n \\
            0, K_x \ge n
        \end{cases} \\
        \\
        \therefore \text{Cov(TA, PE)}
        &= 0 - E(\text{TA}) \cdot E(\text{PE}) \\
        &= - E(\text{TA}) \cdot E(\text{PE})
    \end{aligned}
    $$

In the **final year** of the contract, the assurance **will pay $v^n$ regardless** of the outcome - TA pays if they die while PE pays if they survive. Thus, a simplification can be made to the EPV:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + k} + v^n {}_{n-1}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + n - 1} + v^n {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + v^n ({}_{n-1}p_{x} {}_{}q_{x + n - 1} + {}_{n}p_{x}) \\
    &= \sum^{n-2}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} + v^n {}_{n-1}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    This formula might *seem redundant* because it is not that much simpler than the original, as it only requires **one less probability**:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{3}}
        &= v \cdot q_{x} + v^2 \cdot p_{x}q_{x+1} + v^3 \cdot p_{x}p_{x+1}q_{x+2} + v^3 + {}_{3}p_{x} \\
        &= v \cdot q_{x} + v^2 \cdot p_{x}q_{x+1} + v^3 \cdot {}_{2}p_{x} \\
        &= v \cdot q_{x} + v^2 \cdot p_{x}q_{x+1} + v^3 \cdot p_{x} \cdot p_{x+1} \\
        &= v \cdot q_{x} + v^2 \cdot p_{x}q_{x+1} + v^3 \cdot p_{x} \cdot (1 - q_{x+1})
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    However, this is extremely useful when limited information is provided, allowing us to still be able to calculate the EPV.

### **Deferred Assurances**

Deferred Assurances are variations of any of the above assurances, where the assurance **starts $n$ years later rather** than immediately.

Let **DWL** be the RV denoting the PV of the benefits of the death benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{DWL}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& K_x = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![DWL Discrete](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/DWL%20Discrete.png)

It can be shown to be difference of a WL and TA:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{DWL}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0,& K_x \lt n \\
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1},& K_x \lt n \\
        v^{K_x + 1} ,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases}
    -
    \begin{cases}
        v^{K_x + 1},& K_x \lt n \\
        0,& K_x \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= \text{WL} - \text{TA}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the EPV and Variance can be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{DWL}) &= E(\text{WL}) - E(\text{TA}) \\
    {}_{n|}A_x &= A_x - A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
    \\
    Var (\text{DWL})
    &= {}^{2}_{n|}A_x - ({}_{n|}A_x)^2 \\
    &= \left({}^{2}A_x - {}^{2}A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\right) - \left(A_x - A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\right)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

Alternatively, since a DWL is simply a WL assurance issued $n$ years later, the EPV of the DWL is equivalent to the EPV of a WL issued at age $x+n$ after **adjusting for interest and survival**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n|} A_{x}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = n} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = n} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x}p_{x} \cdot q_{x+K_x} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1 + n} \cdot {}_{K_x+n}p_{x} \cdot q_{x+K_x+n} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} v^{n} \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} {}_{K_x}p_{x+n} \cdot q_{x+K_x+n} \\
    &= v^n {}_{n} p_{x} \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} v^{K_x + 1} \cdot {}_{K_x|}q_{x+n} \\
    &= {}_{n}E_{x} \cdot A_{x+n} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Recall in the previous section that we had to **account for the person surviving** till a certain age. However, now the amount must **also be discounted** to its present value.

    **Multiplying PEs** be used as a factor that that **both discounts accounts for survival**. Conversely, it can be divided to be used as a factor that **accumulates and accounts for death**.

This allows a TA to be expressed as the **difference of two WL assurances issued at different times**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n|} A_{x} &= {}_{n}E_{x} * A_{x+n} \\
    A_x - A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= {}_{n}E_{x} * A_{x+n} \\
    A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= A_{x} - {}_{n}E_{x} * A_{x+n} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![DWL Difference](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/DWL%20Difference.png){.center}

!!! Tip

    This result is **extremely important** as this is the main method of calculating the EPV of a TA of any duration as the values for the WL can be found in the SULT.

    For TAs of 10 or 20 years, the EA and PE method is preferred as it requires fewer values to calculate.

    Note that this result **also applies to the second moment**, allowing us to easily compute the variance of a TA:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}^{2} A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
        &= {}^{2} A_{x} - {}^{2}_{n} E_{x} \cdot {}^{2} A_{x+n}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    The key intuition is understanding that the **discounting factor should be squared**, which is why ${}^{2}_{n} E_{x}$ is also used.

However, if the interest is not 0.05 or if mortality does NOT follow the SULT, then the EPV of a TA must be calculated manually. If so, there is usually a catch that allows the EPV to be easily calculated:

* **Different Interest**: Term of the contract is short (EG. 3 Years)
* **Different Mortality**: Mortality can be simplified (EG. Becomes a constant)
* It is rare to have problems that have both different interest and mortality. In such cases, it is likely that an *adjusted* mortality table is provided.

Another less commonly used deferred assurance is the **Deferred Term Assurance**. As both a **deferred and term** assurance, both results apply to it:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{k|}A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= {}_{k}E_{x} \cdot A^1_{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
    &= {}_{k}E_{x} \cdot (A_{x+k} - {}_{n}E_{x+k} \cdot A_{x+k+n})
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is an extremely common mistake to use the same PE inside and outside.

    They are **completely different**:

    * **Outer PE**: Surviving the deferment period from policy inception
    * **Inner PE**: Surviving the policy term from the starting age

### **Other Calculations**

#### **Recursion**

The EPV of each contract can also be expressed through **backwards recursion**, where it is calculated as a function of itself one year later.

Consider the **WL** random variable:

* If the policyholder **dies** in the year, a **benefit of 1** is paid at the **end of the year**.
* If the policyholder **survives** the year, they "receive" the **PV of the future benefits** at the **end of the year**.
* Since both amounts are at the end of the year, they must be **discounted to the start** of the year.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    WL
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v \cdot 1 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A_{x+1} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    \therefore A_x &= v \cdot {}_{}q_{x} + v \cdot {}_{}p_{x}A_{x+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    The same recursion can be **applied to the second moment** as well, since it is simply the first moment evaluated at a higher interest.

    The only change is that the discounting factor used must be calculated using the **higher interest**.

The same exercise can be shown for the **TA** random variable. The main difference is understanding how the age & duration changes:

* $x+1$ reflects the new age of the policyholder (same as WL)
* $n-1$ reflects that **one year of coverage has passed** (not applicable for WL)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    TA
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        v \cdot 1 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot A^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    \therefore A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= v{}_{}q_{x} + v \cdot {}_{}p_{x} A^1_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Note that since it requires a term policy with a *reduced term*, this recursion is not particularly useful as it is difficult to obtain it.

The **PE** variable is similar, with the main difference being that the policyholder will **receive nothing if the policyholder dies**. Thus, only the second component of the recursion remains:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    PE
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 ,& {}_{}q_{x} \\
        v \cdot {}_{n-1}E_{x+1} ,& {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{n}E_{x} &= v \cdot {}_{}p_{x} \cdot {}_{n-1}E_{x+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

EA recursions are omitted from this section as it is simply the combination of a TA and PE.

#### **Probabilities**

Questions could also ask for the **probability that the present value of the benefits takes on some value** $u$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(\text{WL} \le u)
    &= P(v^{K_x+1} \le u) \\
    &= P \left((K_x+1) \cdot \ln v \le \ln u \right) \\
    &= P \left(K_x+1 \ge \frac{\ln u}{\ln v} \right) \\
    &= P \left(K_x \ge \frac{\ln u}{\ln v} - 1 \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is a **common mistake** to forget to flip the inequality sign as $\ln v \lt 0$.

Questions will **not be as straightforward as above**. Sometimes, the required value of $K_x$ has to be determined **intuitively from the given scenario**.

#### **Percentiles**

Similarly, questions could ask for the **percentile of the PV**.

Since the PV is a transformation of the future lifetime variable, the percentile of the PV **uses the percentile of the future lifetime variable**. 

Thus, we can find the percentile of future lifetime and then substitute that into the PV random variable to obtain its percentile. 

## **Payable M-thly**

A slightly more complicated life assurance contract is one that pays benefits $m$ times a year:

* $m=1$; Paid at the end of the **year** that insured event occurs
* $m=4$; Paid at the end of the **quarter** that insured event occurs
* $m=12$; Paid at the end of the **month** that insured event occurs

This logic can be applied to all other assurances, **EXCEPT for PEs**. This is because they pay out at a **fixed time**, thus there is **NO such thing** as a payable $m$ times PE.

We are now interested in the life status of the policyholder at intervals of $\frac{1}{m}$ years. This can be found by using an **adjusted curtate variable**, which rounds down to the nearest $\frac{1}{m}$ rather than the nearest integer:

$$
    K^{(m)}_{x} = \frac{1}{m} \cdot \lfloor m \cdot T_x \rfloor
$$

It can be intepreted as the probability of **surviving $K^{(m)}_{x}$ full years** and then dying within the next $\frac{1}{m}$ years:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P \left(K^{(m)}_{x} = k \right)
    &= {}_{k}p_{x} \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{m}}q_{x+k} \\
    &= {}_{k \mid \frac{1}{m}}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the PV and EPV of the benefit can then be re-expressed as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Z &= v^{K^{(m)}_{x} + \frac{1}{m}} \\
    \\
    \text{EPV}
    &= \sum B \cdot v^{K^{(m)}_{x} + \frac{1}{m}} \cdot {}_{k}p_{x} \cdot {}_{\frac{1}{m}}q_{x+k} \\
    E(Z)
    &= \sum B \cdot v^{K^{(m)}_{x} + \frac{1}{m}} \cdot {}_{k \mid \frac{1}{m}}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Continuous RV](Assets/3.%20Life%20Assurances.md/Continuous%20RV.png){.center}

The EPVs of the various contracts follow the **same actuarial notation** as before, but with an additional **$(m)$ superscript** to distinguish them:

$$
    A^{(m)}_{x}, A^{1, (m)}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}, A^{(m)}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
$$

Recall previously that we were able to approximate fractional probabilities from discrete ones. Thus, by applying these approximations, we are also to **approximate the m-thly EPVs from the discrete ones** using an appropriate assumption.

#### **Uniform Distribution of Deaths**

We can decompose a WL assurance as the **sum of a series of one year deferred term assurances**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A^{(m)}_{x}
    &= \sum {}_{k \mid}A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} \\
    &= \sum {}_{k}E_{x} \cdot A^1_{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Assuming UDD between integer ages, the deferred one year TAs can be expressed as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A^1_{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{1}}
    &= \sum^{m}_{j=1} v^{\frac{j}{m}} \cdot {}_{\frac{j}{m} \mid \frac{1}{m}}q_{x+k} \\
    &= \sum^{m}_{j=1} v^{\frac{j}{m}} \cdot {}_{\frac{j+1}{m}}q_{x+k} - {}_{\frac{j}{m}}q_{x+k} \\
    &= \sum^{m}_{j=1} v^{\frac{j}{m}} \cdot \left(\frac{j+1}{m} - \frac{j}{m} \right)q_{x+k} \\
    &= \sum^{m}_{j=1} v^{\frac{j}{m}} \cdot \frac{1}{m} q_{x+k} \\
    &= q_{x+k} \cdot \frac{1}{m} \sum^{m}_{j=1} v^{\frac{j}{m}} \\
    &= q_{x+k} \cdot \frac{1}{m} \cdot \frac{v^{\frac{1}{m}}(1-v)}{1-v^{\frac{1}{m}}} \\
    &= q_{x+k} \cdot \frac{1}{m} \cdot \frac{v^{\frac{1}{m}}(1-v)}{v^{\frac{1}{m}}[(1+i)^{m}-1]} \\
    &= q_{x+k} \cdot \frac{1}{m} \frac{1-v}{(1+i)^{m}-1} \\
    &= q_{x+k} \cdot \frac{\frac{1+i-1}{1+i}}{m[(1+i)^{m}-1]} \\
    &= q_{x+k} \cdot \frac{iv}{i^{(m)}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the m-thly EPV can be expressed as a function of the discrete EPV, known as the **UDD Approximation**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A^{(m)}_{x}
    &= \sum {}_{k}E_{x} \cdot A^1_{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} \\
    &= \sum v^{k} {}_{k}p_{x} \cdot q_{x+k} \frac{iv}{i^{(m)}} \\
    &= \frac{i}{i^{(m)}} \cdot \sum v^{k+1} {}_{k}p_{x} q_{x+k} \\
    &= \frac{i}{i^{(m)}} \cdot A_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### **Claims Acceleration Approach**

Given that claims occur every $\frac{1}{m}$ period, then **on average**, the claims **within a year** occur at $\frac{m+1}{2m}$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Average Time of Death}
    &= \frac{\frac{1}{m} + \frac{m}{m}}{2} \\
    &= \frac{\frac{1+m}{m}}{2} \\
    &= \frac{m+1}{2m} \\
    \\
    \therefore Z &= v^{K_{x} + \frac{m+1}{2m}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the m-thly EPV can be expressed as a function of the discrete EPV:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A^{(m)}_{x}
    & \approx \sum^{\infty}_{k = 0} v^{k + \frac{m+1}{2m}} {}_{k|} q_{x} \\
    & \approx v^{\frac{m+1}{2m}-1} \sum^{\infty}_{k = 0} v^{k + 1} {}_{k|} q_{x} \\
    & \approx v^{\frac{m+1-2m}{2m}} A_x \\
    & \approx v^{\frac{-m+1}{2m}} A_x \\
    & \approx v^{-\frac{m-1}{2m}} A_x \\
    & \approx (1+i)^{\frac{m-1}{2m}} A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

This is known as the **Claims Acceleration Approach** as the claims are paid out earlier on in the year as compared to the end. Generally speaking, this approach is *preferred* as it only has one parameter compared to UDD which has two.

!!! Tip

    Generally speaking, the two approaches should produce **similar results**, thus can be used to sense check one another.
    
    However, these **differences are enlarged** when dealing with large benefits as these decimal places will be brought forward, resulting in *seemingly large differences*; thus do not be alarmed!

#### **Common Errors**

The errors covered in this section apply to both kinds of approximation.

The most common mistake is approximating the EPV of an EA. Since there are no continuous PEs, the **approximation must be applied to ONLY the TA component**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    A^{(m)}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    & \ne \frac{i}{i^{(m)}} \cdot A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
    \\
    A^{(m)}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= A^{1, (m)}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}E_x \\
    &= \frac{i}{i^{(m)}} A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}E_x
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Info

    This is why continuous EAs are more appropriately referred to as **Semi-Continuous** EAs, as they contain both a continuous TA and a discrete PE.

Another common mistake occurs when approximating the **second moment**. Since the second moment is evaluated at a higher interest rate, the **approximation factors must reflect this higher interest**:

$$
    {}^{2} A^{(m)}_x = \frac{i^*}{{i^*}^{(m)}} \cdot {}^{2} A_x
$$

#### **Fractional Recursion**

Recursions follow the same logic as the discrete case.

However, since the **benefits are not paid out at JUST the end of the year**, the the **extent that the benefit have to be discounted changes**.

If benefits are paid out every **half a year**:

$$
    A^{(2)}_{x}
    = v^{0.5} \cdot {}_{0.5}q_{x} + v^{0.5} \cdot {}_{0.5}p_{x} A^{(2)}_{x+0.5}
$$

There are two key differences to take note of:

* The extent of discounting changes to half a year
* The age of the future EPV is at a fractional age

Thus, by re-arranging the equation, we can **solve for the fractional age EPV**.

## **Payable Continuously**

In practice, life assurances pay out **immediately** upon the insured event occuring; thus is akin to paying out **continuously** throughout the year.

!!! Tip

    Some questions **may not be very explicit** about paying immediately upon death.

    "Death benefit paid out exactly 4 months later" -- implies that the death benefits are paid out continuously, 4 months from **whatever time the insured dies**.

Since we are interested in the life status of the insured at every possible time, $T_{x}$ is used as the survival model.

The PV and EPV can be re-expressed as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Z
    &= v^{T_x} \\
    &= e^{-\delta \cdot T_x}
\end{aligned}
$$

However, since the distribution is now continuous, the expectation is instead computed via **integration**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV} &= \int^{\infty}_{0} B \cdot v^{t} \cdot f_x(t) \\
    E(Z) &= \int^{\infty}_{0} B \cdot e^{-\delta \cdot t}  \cdot {}_{t}p_{x} \mu_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    When computing the second moment, remember that **BOTH the Benefit and PV must be squared**:

    $$
        E(Z^2) = \int^{\infty}_{0} (B \cdot e^{-\delta \cdot t})^2  \cdot {}_{t}p_{x} \mu_{x+t}
    $$

    It is a common mistake to **forget to square the benefit** since the benefit is usually assumed to be 1.

    Although this applies for all kinds of assurances, the questions that test this concept typically use continuous assurances, which is why this warning is placed here.

Fully continuous assurances follow the **same actuarial notation**, but with an additional **bar accent** to distinguish them:

$$
    \bar{A}_{x}, \bar{A}^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}, \bar{A}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
$$

### **Approximations**

An assurance that pays out continuously can be thought of as a **special case** of an assurance that pays out m-thly, when **m tends to infinity**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    m &\to \infty \\
    \\
    i^{(m)} &\to \delta, \\
    A^{(m)}_{x} &\to \bar{A}_x, \\
    \therefore  \bar{A}_x &= \frac{i}{\delta} A_x \\
    \\
    \frac{m-1}{2m} &\to \frac{1}{2}, \\
    A^{(m)}_{x} &\to \bar{A}_x, \\
    \therefore  \bar{A}_x &= (1+i)^{\frac{1}{2}} A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

Apart from approximations, if the **survival distribution is known**, then they can be **calculated directly** as well.

### **Exponential Distribution**

Recall that given a **constant force of mortality**, the lifetime of the policyholder follows an exponential distribution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_{x} &= e^{-\mu t} \\
    \therefore f(x) &= \mu \cdot e^{-\mu t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the EPVs can be calculated via first principles:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}_x
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} v^{t} \cdot f_x(t) \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} e^{-\delta t}  \cdot \mu \cdot e^{-\mu t} \\
    &= \mu \int^{\infty}_{0} e^{-(\mu + \delta)t} \\
    &= \mu \left[\frac{e^{-(\mu + \delta)t}}{-(\mu + \delta)t} \right]^{\infty}_{0} \\
    &= \mu \left[0 - -\frac{1}{\mu + \delta} \right] \\
    &= \frac{\mu}{\mu + \delta} \\
    \\
    {}_{n}E_{x}
    &= v^{n} \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= e^{-\delta n} \cdot e^{-\mu n} \\
    &= e^{-(\mu + \delta)n}
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the EPV for a WL assurance is **independent of the age of the policyholder**; thus the EPV for a person aged $x$ and aged $x+n$ is the same. This is consistent with the **memoryless property** of the exponential distribution.

Thus, these two values can be used to calculate the EPV of any continuous TA and hence EA:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \bar{A}_{x} - {}_{n}E_{x} \cdot \bar{A}_{x+n} \\
    &= \bar{A}_{x} - {}_{n}E_{x} \cdot \bar{A}_{x} \\
    &= \bar{A}_{x} \cdot (1 - {}_{n}E_{x})
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    For brevity, the second moment is not included in this section. However, it can be easily derived via first principles.

### **Uniform Distribution**

Similarly, following De Moivres law, the survival distribution follows a uniform distribtion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_x &= \frac{w-(x+t)}{w-x} \\
    \mu_{x+t} &= \frac{1}{w-(x+t)} \\
    f(x) &= \frac{1}{\omega-x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the EPV can be calculated via first principles:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{A}_x
    &= \int^{\omega - x}_{0} v^{t} \cdot f_x(t) \\
    &= \int^{\omega - x}_{0} e^{-\delta t} \cdot \frac{1}{\omega - x} \\
    &= \frac{1}{\omega - x} \int^{\omega - x}_{0} e^{-\delta t} \\
    &= \frac{1}{\omega - x} \cdot [\bar{a}_\enclose{actuarial}{t}]^{\omega - x}_{0} \\
    &= \frac{\bar{a}_\enclose{actuarial}{\omega - x}}{\omega - x} \\
    &= \frac{1 - v^{\omega - x}}{\delta} \cdot \frac{1}{\omega - x} \\
    \\
    {}_{n}E_{x}
    &= v^{n} \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    &= e^{-\delta n} \cdot \frac{\omega - (x + n)}{\omega - x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Since the uniform distribution has a limiting age, the upper limit of the integral is $\omega - x$, NOT $\infty$!

Note that the above formulas ONLY apply to continuous assurances. Some questions might provide an exponential or uniform distribution for discrete assurances to confuse us into using them.

In this case, the distribution are only useful in computing the probabilities at every age. The EPV must still be computed via first principles.
