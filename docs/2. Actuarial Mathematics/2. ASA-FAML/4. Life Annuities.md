# **Life Annuities**

## **Overview**

Life Annuity contracts promise to pay out a **stream of benefits** in the future for *as long* the policyholder remains alive. Similar to life insurance, the benefits can be paid discretely or continuously and can be valued through their EPV.

Note that these are different from the annuities covered in Exam FM. The payments for those annuities are made **regardless** of the life of the policyholder, known as **Annuity Certain**. They serve as the foundation to understanding Life Annuities.

Similar to certain annuities, many of the concepts that apply to a life annuity due also apply to a life annuity immediate. Thus, for brevity, the entirety of this section will only cover **life annuities due**, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## **Review: Annuities Certain**

There are two types of payment structures:

<center>

| Period Start | Period End |
| :-: | :-: |
| Paid in Advance | Paid in Arrears |
| Annuity Due | Annuity Immediate |
| $\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$ | $a_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$ |

</center>

<!-- Self Made -->
![Annuity Certain](Assets/4.%20Life%20Annuities.md/Annuity%20Certain.png){.center}

The overall PV of the annuity is the sum of the PV of the stream of payments:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    a_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= v + v^2 + v^3 + \dots + v^n \\
    &= \frac{v-v^{n+1}}{1-v} \\
    &= \sum^n_{k=1} v^k \\
    &= \frac{v(1-v^n)}{1-v} \\
    &= \frac{1-v^n}{i} \\
    \\
    \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= 1 + v + v^2 + \dots + v^n \\
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{k=0} v^k \\
    &= \frac{1- v^{n}}{1-v} \\
    &= \frac{1- v^{n}}{d}
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the payments simply differ by one period and hence one discounting factor:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= 1 + v + v^2 + v^3 + \dots + v^n \\
    &= (1+i) (v + v^2 + v^3 + \dots + v^n) \\
    &= (1+i) \sum^{n}_{k=1} v^k \\
    &= (1+i) a_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

From another perspective, only the payments at the **end points** $t=0$ and $t=n$ are different:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \sum^{n-1}_0 v^k \\
    &= v^0 + \sum^{n-1}_{k=1} v^k \\
    &= 1 + a_{\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}} \\
    &= 1 + a_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - v^n \\
    \\
    \therefore a_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - 1 + v^n
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Payable Discretely**

The simplest form of life annuity due contract pays the benefits at the **beginning of the year**, provided that the insured is alive at that time.

Since we are only interested in the status of the insured at **discrete integer ages**, $K_{x}$ is used as the survival model.

Let $Y$ be the **random variable** denoting the **present value** of the benefit payable. Since the policyholder receives benefits across multiple years, the PV is sum of these benefits and is represented by an **annuity certain**.

$$
    Y = B \cdot \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x} + 1}}
$$

!!! Note

    The PV can be a bit confusing as it is very different from an assurance. They key is understanding that we must **look backwards** to determine **how many payments** the policyholder has received at that age in order to determine the PV.

<!-- Self Made -->
![Life Annuity PV Immediate](Assets/4.%20Life%20Annuities.md/Life%20Annuity%20PV.png){.center}

Thus, the EPV is the expectation of $Y$; it is the sumproduct of ALL possible PVs and their associated probabilities:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV} &= \sum B \cdot \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} \cdot {}_{k}P_{x} {}_{}q_{x+k} \\
    E(Y) &= \sum B \cdot \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The associated probability might seem counter-intuitive, since a life annuity makes payment for as long as the insured is *alive*, so **why are we using the probability of death?**

    The key is understanding that the random variable was defined as the **sum of payments up till that point**. In other words, it assumes that the **policyholder dies at that age** that the PV is calculated.

For simplicity, the benefits are usually assumed to be 1 $(B=1)$. This allows the EPVs to be **easily scaled** for any level of $B$ required.

### **Actuarial Notation**

Most of the notation for Life Assurances applies to Life Annuities as well.

Instead of $A$, $\ddot{a}$ is used to represent annuities. It is intepreted as the present value of a contract where a benefit of 1 is **paid at the beginning of the year** for as long as the **status is active**.

### **Whole Life Annuity**

**Whole Life Annuities** covers the insured **indefinitely** and thus *will* pay out for as long as the insured **survives**.

Let **$\text{WL}_{\text{Due}}$** be the RV denoting the PV of the stream of benefits:

$$
\begin{aligned}
   \text{WL}_{\text{Due}} &=\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x}+1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![WL Due](Assets/4.%20Life%20Annuities.md/WL%20Due.png)

Thus, its EPV can be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{WLA}_{\text{Due}}) &= \sum^{\infty}_{k = 0} \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    \ddot{a}_{x} &= \sum^{\infty}_{k = 0} \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

The EPV can be furthered simplified, allowing a life annuity to be viewed as the **sum of a series of pure endowments**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \ddot{a}_{x}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{k = 0} \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k}} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    &=\sum^{\infty}_{k = 0} \left(\sum^{n-1}_{j=0} v^j \right)  \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    &= v^0 \cdot {}_{0|}q_{x} + (v^0 + v^1) \cdot {}_{1|}q_{x} + (v^0 + v^1 + v^2) \cdot {}_{2|}q_{x} + \dots \\
    &= v^0 ({}_{0|}q_{x} + {}_{1|}q_{x} + \dots) + v^1 ({}_{1|}q_{x} + {}_{2|}q_{x} + \dots) + v^2 ({}_{2|}q_{x} + {}_{3|}q_{x} + \dots) + \dots \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{j=0} v^j \cdot \left(\sum^{\infty}_{k = j} {}_{k|}q_{x} \right) \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{j=0} v^j \cdot {}_{j}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Note that the above formula can be used to easily prove the relationships between different kinds of annuities, but is **NOT a proper definition of an annuity**.
    
    It hence cannot be adjusted to compute the variance or other "special" annuities.

The second moment and variance for all life annuities will be covered in a later section.

### **Temporary Annuity**

**Temporary Life Annuities** covers the insured for a **specified period $n$** and thus pays out for as long as the insured **survives** during that period *only*.

Let **$\text{TA}_\text{Due}$** be the RV denoting the PV of the survival benefit:

$$
\begin{aligned}
   \text{TA}_\text{Due}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
            \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x}+1}},& k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \\
            \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}},& k \ge n \\
    \end{cases} \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{\min(K_{x} + 1, n)}}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![TA Due](Assets/4.%20Life%20Annuities.md/TA%20Due.png)

Thus, the EPV can be determined and simplified using the same approach as before:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{TA}_\text{Due})
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k}} \cdot {}_{k|}q_x + \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \cdot {}_{n}p_x \\
    \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \sum^{n-1}_{j=0} v^j \cdot {}_{j}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to use $n$ as the upper limit of the summation as there are $n$ payments.

    While this is true, the summation **starts from 0**. Thus, for there to be $n$ payments,the summation must end at $n-1$.

!!! Tip

    Intuitively, the EPV of an $n$ year temporary annuity **should NOT be larger than $n$** as there are $n$ payments of 1 which are discounted.

    This can be used as a simple sense check when calculating the EPV.

### **Deferred Annuities**

Deferred Annuities are variations of the above contracts where the assurance **starts $n$ years later** rather than immediately.

Let **$\text{DWL}_{\text{Due}}$** be the RV denoting the PV of a **Deferred Whole Life Annuity Due**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{DWL}_{\text{Due}}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0, & k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \\
        v^n \cdot \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x}+1-n}}, & k \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

It can be expressed as the **difference** between a $\text{WL}_{\text{Due}}$ and a certain annuity for the guaranteed period:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{DWL}_{\text{Due}}
    &= v^n \cdot \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1-n}} \\
    &= v^n \cdot \frac{1-v^{k+1-n}}{d} \\
    &= \frac{v^{n}-v^{k+1}}{d} \\
    &= \frac{(1-v^{k+1}) - (1-v^{n})}{d} \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} -\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{DWL}_{\text{Due}}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0, & k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \\
        \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} -\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} , & k \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Deferred Annuity](Assets/4.%20Life%20Annuities.md/Deferred%20Annuity.png)

Thus, its EPV can be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{DWL}_{\text{Due}})
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=n} (\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} - \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}) \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    {}_{n|}\ddot{a}_{x}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} (\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} - \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}) \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x}
        - \sum^{n-1}_{k=0} (\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} - \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}) \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x}
        - \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x}
        - \sum^{n-1}_{k=0} \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x}
        + \sum^{n-1}_{k=0} \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x}
        - \sum^{n-1}_{k=0} \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x} \\
    &= \ddot{a}_x - \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similar to assurances, its EPV its effectively a $\text{DWL}_{\text{Due}}$ issued at age $x+n$, after **adjusting for interest and survival**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n|}\ddot{a}_{x}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{j=n} v^j \cdot {}_{j}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{j=0} v^{j+n} \cdot {}_{j+n}p_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{j=0} v^{j} v^{n} \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} {}_{j}p_{x+n} \\
    &= v^{n} \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \sum^{\infty}_{j=0} v^{j} \cdot {}_{j}p_{x+n} \\
    &= {}_{n}E_{x} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+n}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, this allows a $\text{TA}_{\text{Due}}$ to be expressed as the **difference of two $\text{WL}_{\text{Due}}$ annuities issued at different times**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n|}\ddot{a}_{x} &= {}_{n}E_{x} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+n} \\
    \ddot{a}_x - \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= {}_{n}E_{x} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+n} \\
    \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \ddot{a}_x - {}_{n}E_{x} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+n}
\end{aligned}
$$

For brevity, **Deferred Temporary Annuities** will NOT be covered. The same concepts and warnings from its assurance counterpart apply to it as well.

### **Guaranteed Annuities**

**Guaranteed Life Annuities** are whole life annuities with a guarantee in the first $n$ years. The benefit will be paid out **even if the insured dies during this period**.

Let **$\text{GA}_{\text{Due}}$** be the RV denoting the PV of the stream of benefits:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{GA}_{\text{Due}}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}},& k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \\
        \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x}+1}},& k \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{max(K_{x}+1,n)}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Since the first payments are paid out regardless, they can be represented using a **certain annuity**.

<!-- Self Made -->
![GA Due](Assets/4.%20Life%20Annuities.md/GA%20Due.png)

It can be manipulated so that it becomes easier to work with:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{GA}_{\text{Due}}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}},& K_{x} = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \\
        \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x}+1}},& K_{x} \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}},& K_{x} = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \\
        \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x}+1}} - \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}},& K_{x} \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
        \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    \end{cases}
    +
    \begin{cases}
        0,& K_{x} = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \\
        \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x}+1}} - \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}},& K_{x} \ge n
    \end{cases} \\
    &=
    \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} +
    \begin{cases}
        0,& K_{x} = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n-1 \\
        \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x}+1}} - \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}},& K_{x} \ge n
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Because of this, they are sometimes referred to as $\text{WL}_{\text{Due}}$ annuities that are **certain for $n$ years**.

Thus, the EPV can be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(\text{GA}_{\text{Due}})
    &= \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + 0 \cdot {}_{n}q_x + \sum^{\infty}_{k = n} (\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} - \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}) \cdot {}_{k|}q_{x}\\
    \ddot{a}_{\overline{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}}
    &= \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n|}\ddot{a}_{x} \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}E_{x} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+n}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is an extremely common mistake to **forget to update the age of the policyholder** in the second term.

    To minimize the chance of this mistake, it is advised to write the expression in terms of the deferred WL first and then convert it.

### **Relationships**

#### **Assurances & Annuities**

Consider the RV for a whole life assurance and annuity due. Notice that the annuity contains the assurance:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{WL} &= v^{K_{x} + 1} \\
    \text{WLA}_{\text{Due}}
    &= \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x}+1}} \\
    &= \frac{1-v^{K_{x} + 1}}{d}
\end{aligned}
$$

This relationship can be applied to their EPVs as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E \left(\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x}+1}} \right)  &= E \left(\frac{1-v^{K_{x} + 1}}{d} \right) \\
    \ddot{a}_{x} &= \frac{1- E \left(v^{K_{x} + 1} \right)}{d} \\
    \ddot{a}_{x} &= \frac{1 - A_{x}}{d} \\
    A_{x} &= 1 - d \ddot{a}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

The same relationship can be shown for a temporary annuity and an **Endowment Assurance, NOT a term assurance**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{TA}_{\text{Due}} &= \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{\min(K_{x} + 1, n)}} \\
    \text{TA} &= {}_{\{K_{x} \le n-1\}} v^{K_{x}+1} \\
    \text{EA} &= v^{\min(K_{x} + 1, n)} \\
    \\
    \therefore
    \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \frac{1 - A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}}{d} \\
    A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= 1 - d \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is a very common mistake to think that term assurances and temporary annuities are related, as both share similar roles.

    However, it becomes clear when considering the random variables and actuarial notation that they are not related.

The same logic can be applied to the **Variance** as well. In fact, this is the **suggested method** of calculating the variance of basic life annuities:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Var} \left(\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x}+1}} \right)
    &= \text{Var} \left(\frac{1-v^{K_{x} + 1}}{d} \right)
    \\
    \text{Var} \left(\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x}+1}} \right)
    &= \frac{1}{d^2} \cdot \text{Var} \left(v^{K_{x} + 1} \right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{d^2} \left[{}_{}^2 A_{x} - (A_{x})^2 \right] \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{Var} \left(\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{\min(K_{x} + 1, n)}} \right)
    &= \frac{1}{d^2} \cdot \left[{}_{}^2 A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - (A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}})^2 \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    There is no need to know the variance for a deferred or guaranteed life annuity.

It is important to note that ${}_{}^2 \ddot{a}_{x}$ is **NOT the second moment** of an annuity:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E \left[(\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x}+1}})^2 \right]
    &= E \left[\left(\frac{1-v^{K_{x} + 1}}{d} \right)^2 \right] \\
    \\
    {}_{}^2 \ddot{a}_{x}
    &= \frac{1 - (v^2)^{K_{x}+1}}{\frac{(1+i)^2 - 1}{1 + (1+i)^2 - 1}} \\
    &= \frac{1 - {}_{}^2 A_{x}}{2d - d^2} \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{Var} \left(\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x}+1}} \right)
    &\ne {}_{}^2 \ddot{a}_{x} - (\ddot{a}_{x})^2
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Despite this, it is still **worthwhile** to know how ${}_{}^2 \ddot{a}_{x}$ relates to ${}_{}^2 A_{x}$ as the question could provide provide ${}_{}^2 \ddot{a}_{x}$ when ${}_{}^2 A_{x}$ is needed.

    The key is understanding that the expression is now evaluated at a **higher interest rate**. Thus, the denominator changes to:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \frac{(1+i)^2 - 1}{1 + {(1+i)^2 - 1}}
        &= \frac{1 + 2i + i^2 - 1}{(1+i)^2} \\
        &= \frac{i^2}{(1+i)^2} + \frac{2i}{(1+i)^2} \\
        &= \left(\frac{i}{1+i} \right)^2 + 2 \left(\frac{i}{1+i} \right)\left(\frac{1}{1+i} \right) \\
        &= d^2 + 2d(1-d) \\
        &= d^2 + 2d - 2d^2 \\
        &= 2d - d^2
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Thus, the second moment of an assurance can be determined:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{}^2 \ddot{a}_{x} &= \frac{1 - {}_{}^2 A_{x}}{2d - d^2} \\
        {}_{}^2 \ddot{a}_{x} (2d - d^2) &= 1 - {}_{}^2 A_{x} \\
        {}_{}^2 A_{x} &= 1 - {}_{}^2 \ddot{a}_{x} (2d - d^2)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

#### **Immediate & Due**

Recall that for Certain Annuities, the only difference between Due and Immediate are the **payments at the start and end times**. This relationship can be extended for Life Annuities as well.

For $\text{WL}_{\text{Due}}$ annuities, since the **end point is infinity**, the difference in the end points can be **ignored**. Thus, the only **difference is the first payment of 1**, which can be easily accounted for:

$$
    a_x = \ddot{a}_x - 1
$$

!!! Note

    This section uses $a_x$ as the focus, as it is assumed that if needed, the due versions will be calculated and then **converted to immediate**, rather than calculating immediate annuities directly.

<!-- Self Made -->
![Life Annuity Due Immediate](Assets/4.%20Life%20Annuities.md/Life%20Annuity%20Due%20Immediate.png)

Unfortunately, the difference at the **end cannot be ignored** for $\text{TA}_{\text{Due}}$ annuities:

$$
    a_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} = \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - 1 + {}_{n}E_x
$$

There is **no need to memorize** this expression as it can be easily derived using the WL conversion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    a_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= a_{x} - {}_{n}E_x a_{x+n} \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{x} - 1 - {}_{n}E_x (\ddot{a}_{x+n} - 1) \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{x} - 1 - {}_{n}E_x \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+n} + {}_{n}E_x \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{x} - {}_{n}E_x \cdot \ddot{a}_{x+n} - 1 + {}_{n}E_x \\
    &= \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - 1 + {}_{n}E_x

For variance, the random variables (which are certain annuities) are used instead:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Var}(\text{WL}_{\text{Immediate}})
    &= \text{Var}(a_{\enclose{actuarial}{k}}) \\
    &= \text{Var}(\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}}-1) \\
    &= \text{Var}(\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}}) \\
    &= \text{Var}(\text{WL}_{\text{Due}}) \\
    \\
    \text{Var}(\text{TA}_{\text{Immediate}})
    &= \text{Var}(a_{\enclose{actuarial}{\min(k,n)}}) \\
    &= \text{Var}(\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{\min(k+1,n+1)}}-1) \\
    &= \text{Var}(\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{\min(k+1,n+1)}}) \\
    &= \text{Var} \left( \frac{1-v^{\min(k+1,n+1)}}{d} \right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{d^2} \text{Var}(v^{\min(k+1,n+1)}) \\
    &= \frac{1}{d^2} \left({}_{2}A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n+1}} - (A_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n+1}})^2 \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the variance is the same for a whole life annuity but **NOT for a temporary annuity**.


### **Other Calculations**

#### **Recursion**

Following the same logic as assurances, Annuities can also be recursively expressed as a function of itself:

* If the policyholder **dies**, nothing happens
* If the policyholder **survives**, they would receive the benefits of the future periods
* **Regardless**, the **benefit of 1 was already paid** at the start of the year

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{WL}_\text{Due}
    &= 1 +
    \begin{cases}
        0,& q_x \\
        v\ddot{a}_{x+1} ,& p_x
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    \therefore \ddot{a}_{x}
    &= 1 + vp_x\ddot{a}_{x+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Annuity Recursion](Assets/4.%20Life%20Annuities.md/Annuity%20Recursion.png)

The same can be shown for TAs, but remember that the remaining duration of the policy must decrease as well:

$$
    \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} = 1 + vp_x \ddot{a}_{x+1:\enclose{actuarial}{n-1}}
$$

#### **Probability**

Questions could also ask for the **probability that the present value of the benefits takes on some value** $u$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(\text{WL}_\text{Due} \le u)
    &= P \left(\frac{1-v^{k+1}}{d} \le u \right) \\
    &= P \left(1-v^{k+1} \le ud \right) \\
    &= P \left(v^{k+1} \ge 1-ud \right) \\
    &= P \left((k+1) \ln v \ge \ln(1-ud) \right) \\
    &= P \left(k+1 \le \frac{\ln(1-ud)}{\ln v} \right) \\
    &= P \left(k \le \frac{\ln(1-ud)}{\ln v} - 1 \right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Similar to assurances, it is a **common mistake** to forget to flip the inequality sign as $\ln v \lt 0$.

Questions will **not be as straightforward as above**. Sometimes, the required value of $K_x$ has to be determined **intuitively from the given scenario**.

For instance, a question may ask for the probability that the sum of undiscounted benefits exceeds its EPV.

Assuming the EPV is 12.5, the policyholder would have to receive **13 benefit payments**. The probability of receiving 13 benefits is equivalent to the **probability of suriving 12 years**.

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to use $K_x \gt 13$, since 13 payments must be made.

    However, since benefits are paid at the **start of the year**, it doesnt matter whether the policyholder survives the 13th year or not; as long as they **survive 12 years to see the 13th year and receive the last required payment**.

The RHS of the expression is unlikely to be an integer. However, $k$ can only take integer values. Thus, the values can **rounded DOWN** to the nearest whole number (EG. 4):

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(k \le \frac{\ln(1-ud)}{\ln v} - 1)
    &= P(k \le 4) \\
    &= P(T_x \le 4) \\
    &= {}_{4}p_x
\end{aligned}
$$

#### **Percentiles**

Similarly, questions could ask for the **percentile of the PV**.

Since the PV is a transformation of the future lifetime variable, the percentile of the PV **uses the percentile of the future lifetime variable**. 

Thus, we can find the percentile of future lifetime and then substitute that into the PV random variable to obtain its percentile. 

## **Payable M-thly**

Similar to assurances, annuities can also be payable $m$ times a year. Most of the key ideas carry over from the assurances, thus this section will will mainly focus on the **unique aspects** for annuities.

Consider the EPV of a payable m-thly whole life annuity due:

$$
    \text{EPV} = B \cdot \ddot{a}^{(m)}_{x}
$$

$B$ is intepreted as the **total benefit paid in the year**. In other words, $\frac{B}{m}$ is paid in each period. This **change in the cashflows** influences how the annuities are converted from one another:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \ddot{a}^{(m)}_{x} &= \ddot{a}^{(m)}_{x} - \frac{1}{m} \\
    \\
    \ddot{a}^{(m)}_{x}
    &= \ddot{a}^{(m)}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - \frac{1}{m} (1 - {}_{n}E_{x})
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Continous RV](Assets/4.%20Life%20Annuities.md/Continuous%20RV.png){.center}

Another difference is in the **interest rates** used to convert annuities and assurances:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \ddot{a}^{(m)}_x &= \frac{1 - A^{(m)}_x}{d^{(m)}}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Uniform Distribution of Deaths**

Since we have already used UDD for assurances and since annuities & assurances are related, we can combine both of them together:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \ddot{a}^{(m)}_x
    &= \frac{1 - A^{(m)}_x}{d^{(m)}} \\
    &= \frac{1 - \frac{i}{i^{(m)}}A_x}{d^{(m)}} \\
    &= \frac{\frac{i^{(m)}-iA_x}{i^{(m)}}}{d^{(m)}} \\
    &= \frac{i^{(m)}-iA_x}{i^{(m)}d^{(m)}} \\
    &= \frac{i^{(m)}-i(1-d\ddot{a}_x)}{i^{(m)}d^{(m)}} \\
    &= \frac{i^{(m)}-i+id\ddot{a}_x}{i^{(m)}d^{(m)}} \\
    &= \frac{id}{i^{(m)}d^{(m)}} \ddot{a}_x - \frac{i-i^{(m)}}{i^{(m)}d^{(m)}} \\
    &= \alpha(m)\ddot{a}_x - \beta(m) \\
    \\
    \therefore \alpha(m) &= \frac{id}{i^{(m)}d^{(m)}} \\
    \\
    \therefore \beta(m) &= \frac{i-i^{(m)}}{i^{(m)}d^{(m)}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Recall that nominal and effective rates are linked using:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        i^{(m)} &= m[(1+i)^\frac{1}{m}-1] \\
        d^{(m)} &= m[1-(1+d)^\frac{1}{m}]   
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    However, for $i=0.05$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are **provided inside the SULT** for common values of $m$, thus there is no need to waste precious time calculating them.

### **Woolhouse Approximation**

Since a continuous annuity can be expressed as a sum of **discrete pure endowments**, the trapezoidal rule and euler-macluarin correction can be used to approximate its EPV.

The key difference from before is understanding that the EPV of an annuity due is a **LEFT riemann sum** as there is a payment at time 0.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{a}_x
    &= \int^{\infty}_0 v^t {}_{t}p_x \\
    & \approx h[f(a) + f(a+h) + \dots + f(b-h)] - \frac{h}{2} [f(a)-f(b)] + \frac{h^2}{12} [f'(a)-f'(b)]
\end{aligned}
$$

The first derivatives can be found below:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f'(n)
    &= \frac{d}{dt} (e^{-\delta n} {}_{n}p_x) \\
    &= {}_{n}p_x \delta e^{-\delta n} - e^{-\delta n} {}_{n}p_x \mu_{x+n} \\
    &= e^{-\delta n} {}_{n}p_x (\delta + \mu_{x+n}) \\
    &= {}_{n}E_x (\delta + \mu_{x+n}) \\
    \\
    \therefore f'(0) &= -(\delta + \mu_{x}) \\
    \therefore f'(\infty) &= 0
\end{aligned}
$$

Assuming $h=1$,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{a}_x
    & \approx (1) [{}_{0}E_x + {}_{1}E_x + \dots + {}_{\infty-1}E_x] - \frac{1}{2} [{}_{0}E_x-{}_{\infty-1}E_x] + \frac{1}{12} [-(\delta + \mu_{x}) - 0] \\
    & \approx [1 + {}_{n}E_1 + \dots] - \frac{1}{2} [1-0] - \frac{1}{12} (\delta + \mu_{x}) \\
    & \approx \ddot{a}_x - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{12} (\delta + \mu_{x})
\end{aligned}
$$

Assuming $h=\frac{1}{m}$ instead,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{a}_x
    & \approx \left(\frac{1}{m} \right) [{}_{0}E_x + {}_{\frac{1}{m}}E_x + \dots + {}_{\infty-\frac{1}{m}}E_x] - \frac{1}{2m} [{}_{0}E_x-{}_{\infty-\frac{1}{m}}E_x] + \frac{1}{12m^2} [-(\delta + \mu_{x}) - 0] \\
    & \approx \left(\frac{1}{m} \right) [1 + {}_{\frac{1}{m}}E_x + \dots] - \frac{1}{2m} [1-0] - \frac{1}{12m^2} (\delta + \mu_{x}) \\
    & \approx \ddot{a}^{(m)}_x - \frac{1}{2m} - \frac{1}{12m^2} (\delta + \mu_{x})
\end{aligned}
$$

Combining both together,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{a}_x &= \bar{a}_x \\
    \ddot{a}_x - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{12} (\delta + \mu_{x}) & \approx \ddot{a}^{(m)}_x - \frac{1}{2m} - \frac{1}{12m^2} (\delta + \mu_{x}) \\
    \ddot{a}^{(m)}_x
    & \approx \ddot{a}_x - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{12} (\delta + \mu_{x}) + \frac{1}{2m} + \frac{1}{12m^2} (\delta + \mu_{x}) \\
    & \approx \ddot{a}_x - (\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{2m}) - (\frac{1}{12} - \frac{1}{12m^2})(\delta + \mu_{x}) \\
    & \approx \ddot{a}_x - \frac{m-1}{2m} - \frac{m^2-1}{12m^2}(\delta + \mu_{x})
\end{aligned}
$$

This process is known as the **Woolhouse Approximation**. If the error term is omitted, then it is known as the **2-term Woolhouse Approximation** else it is known as the **3-term Woolhouse Approximation**.

The 3-term woolhouse approximation is *extremely accurate* due to its mathematical roots. It so much more accurate than UDD such that when calculating a continuous *assurance*, it is advisable to calculate the corresponding annuity using the 3 term approximation first and then convert it, for the best results.

Unfortunately, the drawback is that it requires knowledge about the force of mortality, which is not commonly provided in life tables. Thus, although less accurate, the **2 term approach can be easily used** in any situation.

### **Term Approximations**

Unlike assurances, the approximations for annuities have multiple components. Thus, the approximations for term annuities are slightly different from the ones used for WL.

However, there is **NO need to remember a seperate expression** for it, it can be calculated by converting the WL to a TA:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \ddot{a}^{(m)}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \ddot{a}^{(m)}_{x} - {}_{n}E_x \ddot{a}^{(m)}_{x+n} \\
    &= \alpha(m)\ddot{a}_x - \beta(m) - {}_{n}E_x [\alpha(m)\ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - \beta(m)] \\
    &= \alpha(m)\ddot{a}_x - \beta(m) - {}_{n}E_x \alpha(m)\ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - {}_{n}E_x \beta(m) \\
    &= \alpha(m) [\ddot{a}_x - {}_{n}E_x \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}] - \beta(m) [1-{}_{n}E_x] \\
    &= \alpha(m) \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - \beta(m) [1-{}_{n}E_x]
\end{aligned}
$$

A similar approach can be taken for the woolhouse approximation, resulting in the following:

$$
    a^{(m)}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} = \ddot{a}_{x:n} - \frac{m-1}{2m} (1-{}_{n}E_{x})
$$

### **Fractional Recursion**

Recursions follow the same logic as the discrete case.

However, since the **benefits are not paid out at JUST the start of the year**, the the **extent that future benefits have to be discounted changes**.

If benefits are paid out every **half a year**:

$$
    \ddot{a}^{(2)}_{x}
    = 1 + v^{0.5} p_x\ddot{a}^{(2)}_{x+0.5}
$$

There are two key differences to take note of:

* The extent of discounting changes to half a year
* The age of the future EPV is at a fractional age

Thus, by re-arranging the equation, we can **solve for the fractional age EPV**.

## **Payable Continuously**

Similarly, annuities can also be paid continuously. All the concepts are **exactly the same as the assurances**, thus this section will just be stating the final results.

### **Approximations**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{a}_{x} &= \alpha(\infty)\ddot{a}_x - \beta(\infty) \\
    \\
    \bar{a}_{x} &= \ddot{a}_x - \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{12}(\delta + \mu_{x})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Exponential Distribution**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \bar{a}_{x}
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} v^{t} {}_{t}P_{x} \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} e^{- \delta t} \cdot e^{- \mu t} \\
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} e^{- (\mu + \delta)t} \\
    &= \frac{1}{\mu + \delta} \\
    \\
    \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \bar{a}_{x} - {}_{n}E_{x} \bar{a}_{x+n} \\
    &= \bar{a}_{x} \cdot (1 - {}_{n}E_{x})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Uniform Distribution**

Even though the distribution is known, it is **difficult to integrate** for the annuity EPV.

Thus, it is recommended to compute the **EPV of a continuous assurance and then convert it** into a continuous annuity:

$$
    \bar{a}_{x} = \frac{1 - \bar{A}_{x}}{\delta}
$$
