# **Survival Models**

This section assumes some basic knowledge on **Probability Theory**, which can be found under another set of notes covering a [Review of Probability Theory](../ASA-FAMS/1. Review of Probability Theory.md).

## **Overview**

Survival Models are probability distributions that measure the **time to failure** of an entity.

In an actuarial context, it measures the **time to death** of a person. From another perspective, it also measures the **future lifetime** of that person.

!!! Note

    If someone is going to die in 5 years, then the person only has 5 years left to live (future lifetime).

Intuitively, the distribution depends heavily on the age of the person, which is denoted using $(x)$, which denotes a **life aged $x$**.

## **Continuous Lifetime**

The distribution of the time to death (**in years**) is represented using the **Continuous Random Variable** $T_{x}$, where $x$ represents the age of the person.

!!! Note

    Although we often use integer values for time, it can be expressed in continuous form as well:

    * **1 Year** = 12 Months
    * **0.5 Years** =  6 Months
    * **0.541 Years** = 6 Months & 15 Days

Since $T_{x}$ represents the time to death, a person aged $x$ will live for another $T_{x}$ years and then die before age $x + T_{x}$:

![Continuous RV](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Continuous%20RV.png){.center}

The probability that the person **dies DURING the next $t$ years before age $x+t$** is given by the **CDF** of the distribution:

$$
    F_{x}(t) = P(T_{x} \le t)
$$

!!! Note

    The implicit assumption is that the person aged $x$ **just turned age $x$** (on their birthday).

    Thus, dying within the next $t$ years means that they will not live to turn age $x+t$.

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![CDF Timeline](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/CDF%20Timeline.png){.center}

The complement of the CDF is the probability that the person **dies AFTER the next $t$ years**. From another perspective, this also means that the person **survives the next $t$ years to age $x+t$**, which is why it is known as the **Survival Function**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S_{x}(t)
    &= P(T_{x} \gt t) \\
    &= 1 - P(T_{x} \lt t) \\
    &= 1 - F_{x}(t) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

![Survival Timeline](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Survival%20Timeline.png){.center}

Since they are complements of one another, they share similar properties:

<center>

| CDF | Survival Function | Intuition |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| $F_{x}(0) = 0$ | $S_{x}(0) = 1$ | Humans are currently alive |
| $F_{x}(\infty) = 1$ | $S_{x}(\infty) = 0$ | Humans will inevitably die |
| Non-decreasing function | Non-increasing function | Probability of death increases with age |

</center>

!!! Warning

    The first property is hard to intepret. The probability that a life aged $x$ dies within 0 years before age $x+0$ must be 0, since the person is *already* aged $x$.

The above two can also be *combined* into the probability of **surviving $u$ years** till age $x+u$ and then **dying within the following $t$ years** before age $x+u+t$, known as the **Probability of Deferred Death**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(u \lt T_x \lt t+u)
    &= P(T_x \lt t+u) - P(T_x \lt u) \\
    &= [1 - P(T_x \gt t+u)] - [1 - P(T_x \gt u)] \\
    &= P(T_x \gt u) - P(T_x \gt t+u) \\
    &= P(T_x \gt u) - P(T_x \gt u) \cdot P(T_{x+u} \gt t) \\
    &= P(T_x \gt u) [1 - P(T_{x+u} \gt t)] \\
    &= P(T_x \gt u) \cdot P(T_{x+u} \lt t) \\
    &= S_{x}(u) \cdot F_{x+t}(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Remember that the second term reflects the **"new" age** of the person after surviving $u$ years till age $x+u$.

![Deferred Death Timeline](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Deferred%20Death%20Timeline.png){.center}

Using **Only Survival Functions**, it is represented as the probability that the person **survives $u$ years but does not survive past $u+t$ years**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(u \lt T_x \lt t+u)
    &= P(T_x \lt t+u) - P(T_x \lt u) \\
    &= [1 - P(T_x \gt t+u)] - [1 - P(T_x \gt u)] \\
    &= P(T_x \gt u) - P(T_x \gt t+u) \\
    &= S_{x}(u) - S_{x}(t+u)
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Deferred Death only CDF](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Deferred%20Death%20only%20Survival.png){.center}

Using **Only Death Functions**, it is represented as the probability of dying within $u+t$ years but NOT $u$ years:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(u \lt T_{x} \lt u+t)
    &= P(T_x \lt u+t) - P(T_x \lt u) \\
    &= F_{x} (u+t) - F_{x}(u)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    An easy way to remember the different formulations (especially the ones involving only death or survival) is to **visualize** them, as seen above.

    Notice that all the **red lines NOT on the timeline** represents the time where the **person is alive** under that probability. Find the combination of probabilities that results in a **difference during the period we want the policyholder to die**.

### **Newborn Lifetime**

Note that one implicit assumption made so far is that the person has **already survived till age $x$**.

In order to further analyze this, we must consider a special case of the distribution for a **newborn aged 0**, represented by $T_{0}$.

The future lifetime variable is essentially **conditioned** on the newborn having survived $x$ years, then dying within the following $t$ years before age $x+t$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    T_{x} &= T_{0} - x \mid T_{0} \gt x \\
    \\
    P(T_x \le t)
    &= P(T_0 \le x + t \mid T_0 \gt x) \\
    &= \frac{P(x \lt T_0 \lt x +t)}{P(T_0 \gt x)} \\
    &= \frac{P(T_0 \lt x +t)-P(T_0 \lt x)}{P(T_0 \gt x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![CDF Illustration](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/CDF%20Illustration.png){.center}

When written in terms of the survival function, it can be simplified even further:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(T_x \ge t)
    &= P(T_0 \ge x + t | T_0 \gt x) \\
    &= \frac{P(T_0 \gt x + t)}{P(T_0 \gt x)} \\
    &= \frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Since the surviving till age $x$ is a **subset** of surviving till age $x+t$, the numerator can be simplified to just the probability of surviving till age $x+t$.

This leads to the **Multiplication Rule** of survival probabilities:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S_x(t) &= \frac{S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x)} \\
    S_0(x+t) &= S_0(x)S_x(t) \\
    \\
    \therefore S_x(t+u) &= S_x(u) S_{x+u}(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

The survival probability can be decomposed into two components:

1. The probability of a person surviving $u$ years
2. The **conditional probability** of person who has survived $u$ years (new age) surviving *another* $t$ years

!!! Warning

    This result **ONLY applies to the survival probabilities**!

### **Actuarial Notation**

Given how often the survival function is used, they are often abbreviated using the **International Actuarial Notation**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(T_{x} \lt t) &= {}_{t}q_{x} \\
    P(T_{x} \gt u) &= {}_{t}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    If $t=1$, it is omitted - EG. ${}_{1}q_{x} = q_{x}$.

Deferred Deaths are expressed using the **pipe symbol**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(u \lt T_{x} \lt t+u)
    &= {}_{u \mid t}q_{x} \\
    &= {}_{u}p_{x} \cdot {}_{t}q_{x+t} \\
    &= {}_{u}p_{x} - {}_{u+t}p_{x} \\
    &= {}_{t+u}q_{x} - {}_{u}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Other key results:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t+u}p_{x} &= {}_{u}p_{x} \cdot {}_{t}p_{x+u} \\
    {}_{t}p_{x} &= \sum^{t}_{u = t} {}_{u|}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Percentiles**

Recall that the definition of a percentile is the value of the random variable at which $100p$ of the values fall below.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(T_{x} \le t) &\le p \\
    P(T_{x} \ge t) &\le 1 - p \\
    {}_{t}P_{x} &\le 1 - p \\
    \frac{\ell_{x+t}}{\ell_{x}} &\le 1 - p \\
    \ell_{x+t} &\le \ell_{x} \cdot (1-p) \\ 
\end{aligned}
$$

By comparing values in the life table, we can find the **smallest age** that fulfils the above inequality, $y$.

Since it is unlikely that $\ell_{x} \cdot (1-p)$ exactly matches a value, the true percentile is at a **fractional age**.

$$
    y - 1 \lt x + t \lt y
$$

Thus, one of the **typical assumptions** must be used to determine the exact median of the distribution.

$$
    \text{Continuous Percentile} = y - 1 + t
$$

However, if only interested in the curtate lifetime, then we can simply take the **floor** of $x+t$, which is always $y-1$.

$$
    \text{Curtate Percentile} = y - 1
$$

!!! Note

    We traditionall learn percentiles using **increasing random variables**. We usually think of percentiles as values from the **beginning to the percentile**.
    
    However, future lifetime is a **decreasing variable**. This means that all values that are smaller than the percentile come AFTER it. This means that the values are from the percentile to its upper limit:

## **Discrete Lifetime**

Similarly, the distribution of the time to death (**in years**) can also be represented using a **Discrete Random Variable** $K_{x}$, where $x$ represents the age of the person.

It is also known as the **Curtate Future Lifetime** as it only contains the **integer components** of the continuous future lifetime.

Mathematically, it is represented as a continuous lifetime variable that has been **floored**. Thus, given the continuous distribution, the curtate one can be determined:

$$
    K_x = \lfloor T_x \rfloor
$$

!!! Info

    The definition of Curtate is "shortened"; it represents how the continuous distribution has been reduced to just its integer components.

    Another way to remember is that $K$ stands for **Kurtate**.

The intepretation of $K_{x}$ has changed slightly - A person aged $x$ will live for another $K_x$ **FULL years** and then die before age $x + K_{x} + 1$:

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Curate Timeline](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Curtate%20Timeline.png){.center}

!!! Warning

    It is a very common mistake to misintepret $K_x$, thus consider the following examples:

    A person aged $x$ **dies within the same year**. They have **lived for 0 full years** since turning $x$, thus $K_x = 0$.

    A person aged $x$ lives till their $x+1$ birthday but dies in that year. They have **lived for 1 full year** since turning $x$, thus $K_x = 1$.

$K_x = k$ can also be intepreted more intuitively as the **deferred probability of living $k$ years and then dying the following year**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(K_x = k)
    &= P(k \le T_x \lt k+1) \\
    &= P(T_x \lt k+1) - P(T_x \le k) \\
    &= {}_{k+1}q_{x} - {}_{k}q_{x} \\
    &= {}_{k}p_{x} - {}_{k+1}p_{x} \\
    &= {}_{k}p_{x} - {}_{k}p_{x} \cdot {}_{1}p_{x+k} \\
    &= {}_{k}p_{x} \cdot (1 - {}_{1}p_{x+k}) \\
    &= {}_{k}p_{x} \cdot {}_{1}q_{x+k} \\
    &= {}_{k \mid 1}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Recall that the probability of deferred death can be represented in three different ways, thus the PDF may take on different formulations:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{u \mid 1}q_{x}
        &= {}_{u}p_{x} \cdot {}_{}q_{x+t} \\
        &= {}_{u}p_{x} - {}_{u+1}p_{x} \\
        &= {}_{u+1}q_{x} - {}_{u}q_{x}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

## **Force of Mortality**

${}_{h}q_{x}$ is the probability of dying within $h$ years:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{h}q_{x}
    &= 1 - {}_{h}q_{x} \\
    &= 1 - \frac{S_0(x+h)}{S_0(x)} \\
    &= \frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+h)}{S_0(x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

The **Force of Mortality** $(\mu_{x})$ is the probability that (x) dies within an **infinitely small $h$**; in other words, the **probability of dying instantly**.

We consider the rate of death per unit time (this is NOT a probability!):

$$
    \frac{{}_{h}q_{x}}{h} = \frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+h)}{h \cdot S_0(x)}
$$

!!! Note

    The proof uses the first principles of differentiation, which measures the rate of change of $y$ over an infinitely small unit of $x$, which is why the rate of death had to be considered.

    This also implies that the following is true, ONLY for **SMALL values** of $h$:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \mu_{x} &= \frac{{}_{h}q_{x}}{h} \\
        {}_{h}q_{x} &= h \cdot \mu_{x}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

As the period of time becomes infinitely small,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu_{x}
    &= \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+h)}{S_0(x)h} \\
    &= \frac{1}{S_0(x)} \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{S_0(x) - S_0(x+h)}{h} \\
    &= - \frac{1}{S_0(x)} \lim_{h \to 0} \frac{S_0(x+h) - S_0(x)}{h} \\
    &= - \frac{1}{S_0(x)} \cdot \left(\frac{d}{dx} S_0(x) \right) \\
    &= - \frac{S'_0(x)}{S_0(x)} \\
    &= - \frac{d}{dx} \ln S_0(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is an extremely **common mistake to forget the minus sign** in front of the expression.

    Another common mistake is forgetting how to differentiate a fraction within a logarithm:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \frac{d}{dx} \ln \frac{4}{4+x^2}
        &= \frac{4+x^2}{4} \cdot - 4(4+x)^{-2} \cdot 2x \\
        &= - \frac{2x}{4+x^2}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

Using the PDF of the newborn distribution, the force of mortality can be rewritten accordingly:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_0(x)
    &= \frac{d}{dx} F_0(x) \\
    &= \frac{d}{dx} (1 - S_0(x)) \\
    &= -S'_0(x) \\
    \\
    \therefore \mu_{x} &= \frac{f_0(x)}{S_0(x)}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    The force of mortality can also be expressed as the following:

    $$
        \mu_{x}(t) = \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q_{x}}{{}_{t}p_{x}}
    $$

    We can think of this as a **conditional probability**:

    $$
        P(\text{A} \mid \text{B}) = \frac{P(\text{A} \cap \text{B})}{P(\text{B})}
    $$

    Thus, the force of mortality can be understood as the "probability" that $x$ **dies instantly** after $t$ years, **given that they survive $t$ years**.

### **Generalization**

The force of mortality is currently defined using the newborn distribution:

$$
    \mu_{y} = - \frac{\frac{d}{dy} S_0(y)}{S_0(y)}
$$

For (x), $y = x + t$, where t is a random:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    dy
    &= dx + dt \\
    &= 0 + dt \\
    &= dt \\
    \\
    \therefore \mu_{x+t}
    &= - \frac{\frac{d}{dt} S_0(x+t)}{S_0(x+t)} \\
    &= - \frac{d}{dt} \ln S_0(x+t)
\end{aligned}
$$

Since integration is the reverse of differentiation,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int^{n}_{0} \frac{d}{dt} \ln S_0(x+t) &= - \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t} \\
    [\ln S_0(x+t)]^{n}_{0} &= - \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t} \\
    \ln S_0(x+n) - \ln S_0(x) &= - \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t} \\
    \ln \frac{S_0(x+n)}{\ln S_0(x)} &= - \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t} \\
    \ln S_{x}(n) &= - \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t} \\
    S_{x}(n) &= e^{- \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t}} \\
    {}_{n}p_{x} &= e^{- \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The exponent is also known as the **Cumulative Force of Mortality**.

    Outside of human survival, the force of mortality is more generally known as the **Hazard Function**, denoted by $h(x)$. Its integral is known as the **Cumulative Hazard Function**, denoted by $H(x)$.

    $$
        H(x) = \int^{n}_{0} h(x)
    $$

    Although rare, a question could *directly* provide the cumulative hazard function and ask to compute the survival probability. In such cases, DO NOT integrate it once more!

!!! Info

    This expression can be intuitively understood as the following:

    1. Consider the forces trying to kill the individual.
    2. Negate these forces; only consider the scenario that the person lives.
    3. Take the exponent to compute the probability.

Following a similar generalization (proof not shown), the PDF can also be expressed using the force of mortality:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu_{x} &= \frac{f_0(x)}{S_0(x)} \\
    f_0(x) &= S_0(x) \cdot \mu_{x} \\
    f_x(t) &= S_x(t) \cdot \mu_{x+t} \\
    f_x(t) &= {}_{t}p_{x} \cdot \mu_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

This can be intepreted as the **probability of dying instantly** at age $x+t$.

### **Risk Adjustments**

There are people who have a **higher risk of dying** than the average person - EG. Smokers.

The **first method** to account for their increased risk is to **treat them as an older person** (higher risk), known as an **Age Rating**.

An $n$ year age rating means that a person aged $x$ should be treated as if they had the mortality of a person aged $x+n$.

**Another method** would be to simply **scale the mortality rates** by a factor to increase it:

$$
    {}_{}q'_{x} = c \cdot {}_{}q'_{x}
$$

The **last method** would be to **adjust the force of mortality** instead, by either adding or multiplying a constant to it:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{}p'_{x}
    &= e^{- (\int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t} + k)} \\
    &= e^{- \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t} - kn} \\
    &= e^{- \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t}} \cdot e^{-kn} \\
    &= {}_{}p'_{x} \cdot e^{-kn} \\
    \\
    {}_{}p'_{x}
    &= e^{- k\int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t}} \\
    &= (e^{- \int^{n}_{0} \mu_{x+t}})^k \\
    &= ({}_{}p_{x})^k
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Survival Summary**

<!-- Self Made -->
![Survival Summary](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Survival%20Summary.png){.center}

## **Moments**

### **Continuous Moments**

The first raw moment of the distribution is known as the **Complete Expectation of Life**, which can be calculated via first principles:

$$
    E(T_{x}) = \int_{0}^{\infty} t \cdot f_x(t) \\
$$

Note that integrating this expression directly requires **integration by parts**, which can be time consuming, this it can be simplified using the **Survival Function Method**.

Recall that in the previous section we found that the PDF and the survival function are related:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{x}(t) &= - \frac{d}{dt} S_{x}(t) \\
    \therefore \int f_{x}(t) &= -S_{x}(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

This result can be used to simplify the integration by parts:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(T_{x})
    &=  \Bigl[t \cdot \int f_x(t) \Bigr]_0^\infty - \int_{0}^{\infty} \int f_x(t) \cdot 1 \\
    &=  \Bigl[t \cdot (-S_X(t)) \Bigr]_0^\infty - \int_{0}^{\infty} (-S_X(x)) \\
    &= tS_X(\infty) - tS_X(0) + \int_{0}^{\infty} S_X(x) \\
    &= \infty \cdot (0) - 0 \cdot 1 + \int_{0}^{\infty} S_X(x) \\
    &= \int_{0}^{\infty} S_X(x) \\
    &= \int_0^\infty {}_{t}p_x
\end{aligned}
$$

The same logic can be applied to the second raw moment as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(T^2_x)
    &= \int_{0}^{\infty} t^2 \cdot f_x(t) \\
    &= \Bigl[t^2 \cdot \int f_x(t) \Bigr]_0^\infty - \int_{0}^{\infty} \int f_x(t) \cdot 2t \\
    &= \Bigl[t^2 \cdot S_x(t)\Bigr]_0^\infty - \int_{0}^{\infty} 2t \cdot S_x(t) \\
    &= t^2 \cdot S_x(\infty) - t^2 \cdot S_x(0) - \int_{0}^{\infty} 2t \cdot S_x(t) \\
    &= (\infty)^2 \cdot 0 - 0^2 \cdot 1 - \int_{0}^{\infty} 2t \cdot S_x(t) \\
    &= \int_{0}^{\infty} 2t \cdot {}_{t}p_x
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    More generally, the survival function method can be expressed as the following:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \int_{0}^{\infty} g(x) \cdot f_x(t)
        &= \int_{0}^{\infty} g'(x) \cdot S_x(t)
    \end{aligned}
    $$

The Variance is simply the difference of the first two raw moments with **no special simplification**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Var(T_x)
    &= E(T^2_x) - [E(T_x)]^2 \\
    &= 2 \int_{0}^{\infty} t \cdot {}_{t}p_x - \left(\int_0^\infty {}_{t}p_x \right)^2
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Discrete Moments**

Similarly, the expectation of the discrete distribution is known as the **Expectation of Curtate Lifetime**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(K_x)
    &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k \cdot {}_{k \mid 1}q_{x} \\
    &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k ({}_{k}p_{x} - {}_{k+1}p_{x}) \\
    &= 1 ({}_{1}p_{x} - {}_{2}p_{x}) + 2 ({}_{2}p_{x} - {}_{3}p_{x}) + 3 ({}_{3}p_{x} - {}_{4}p_{x}) + ... \\
    &= {}_{1}p_{x} - {}_{2}p_{x} + 2 {}_{2}p_{x} - 2{}_{3}p_{x} + 3 {}_{3}p_{x} - 3 {}_{4}p_{x} \\
    &= {}_{1}p_{x} + {}_{2}p_{x} + {}_{3}p_{x} + ... \\
    &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} {}_{k}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Summation starts from 1 as the first term is cancelled
    Probability tree perspective

The second moment can be calculated in a similar fashion:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(K^2_x)
    &= \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} k^2 ({}_{k}p_{x} - {}_{k+1}p_{x}) \\
    &= 1 ({}_{1}p_{x} - {}_{2}p_{x}) + 4 ({}_{2}p_{x} - {}_{3}p_{x}) + 9 ({}_{3}p_{x} - {}_{4}p_{x}) + ... \\
    &= {}_{1}p_{x} - {}_{2}p_{x} + 4{}_{2}p_{x} - 4{}_{3}p_{x} + 9 {}_{3}p_{x} - 9 {}_{4}p_{x} \\
    &= {}_{1}p_{x} + 3{}_{2}p_{x} + 5 {}_{3}p_{x} + ... \\
    &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (2k-1) {}_{k}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, the variance has **no special simplifications**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Var(K_x)
    &= E(K_x^2) - [E(K_x)]^2 \\
    &= \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} (2k-1) {}_{k}p_{x} - \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} {}_{k}p_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Temporary Expectation**

If the future lifetime variable is artifically limited to $n$ years, then the expectation is known as the **n-year temporary complete/curtate expectation of life**.

It is intepreted as the number of years that the person is expected to live **out of the next $n$ years** ONLY.

If the person lives past $n$ years, then only $n$ years are recorded. Thus, it can be represented using a **minimum function**:

$$
    \min (T_x, n)
    =
    \begin{cases}
        T_x,& T_x \lt n \\
        n,& T_x \gt n
    \end{cases}
$$

In order to easily represent and distinguish it from the full counterpart, the following **actuarial notation** is used:

<center>

|  | Complete | Curtate |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| **Full** | $\mathring{e}_{x}$ | $e_{x}$ |
| **Temporary** | $\mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$ | $e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$ |

</center>

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_{x} &= \int^{\infty}_0 {}_{t}p_x \\
    \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \int^{n}_0 {}_{t}p_x \\
    \\
    e_{x} &= \sum^{\infty}_0 {}_{k}p_x \\
    e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \sum^{n}_0 {}_{k}p_x
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Decomposition**

The *complete* expectation can be **decomposed** into two components:

1. **Term Expectation** at the *current age* representing the "early" years
2. **Complete Expectation** at a *future age* represenging the "later" years

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_x &\approx \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + \mathring{e}_{x+n} \\
    e_x &\approx e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + e_{x+n}
\end{aligned}
$$

However, the above makes an implicit assumption that the person **will survive the first n years**. Thus, the second term needs to **account for the probability of surviving** those n years:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_x &= \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot \mathring{e}_{x+n} \\
    e_x &= e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot e_{x+n}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Many questions require us to use this equation, but **may not directly provide the values at $x+n$**, requiring us to go through other steps to calculate it.

    This can sometimes **confuse us** into thinking that the decomposition is different. For instance, if $x+n$ is 60, but the questions provide 61, we may inadvertently think that $x+n$ is 61 under stress.

Similarly, a temporary expectation can be further decomposed into more temporary expectations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{m+n}}
    &= \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{m}} + {}_{m}p_{x} \cdot \mathring{e}_{x+m:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
    e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{m+n}}
    &= e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{m}} + {}_{m}p_{x} \cdot e_{x+m:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Temporary Expectation Decomposition](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Temporary%20Expectation%20Decomposition.png){.center}

For the **curtate expectation only**, if $n=1$, it leads to a **recursion**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    e_x
    &= e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} + {}_{}p_{x} \cdot e_{x+1} \\
    &= {}_{}p_{x} + {}_{}p_x \cdot e_{x+1} \\
    &= {}_{}p_{x} (1 + e_{x+1})
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Consider the future lifetime variable for just the coming year:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{1}}
        &=
        \begin{cases}
            1, {}_{}p_{x} \\
            0, {}_{}q_{x}
        \end{cases} \\
        \\
        \therefore
        e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{1}}
        &= 1 \cdot {}_{}p_{x} + 0 \cdot {}_{}q_{x} \\
        &= {}_{}p_{x}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

### **Discrete Continuous Link**

Note that the two expectations are similar to one another:

* **Continuous Expectation** - Area under survival function
* **Discrete Expectation** - Right **Riemann Sum** of the area under the survival function

<!-- Obtained from Story of Mathematics -->
![Riemann Sum](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Right%20Riemann%20Sum.png){.center}

Recall from Calculus that the area under a curve can be estimated through the **Trapezium Rule**, which states that the area is *approximately equal* to the sum of the area of discrete trapeziums formed under the curve.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int^b_a f(x)
    & \approx \sum \text{Area of Trapezium} \\
    & \approx \sum \frac{1}{2} h \left[f(a+kh) + f(a+(k+1)h) \right] \\
    & \approx \frac{h}{2}[f(a) + f(a+h)] + \frac{h}{2}[f(a+h) + f(a+2h)] + \dots + \frac{h}{2}[f(b-h) + f(b)] \\
    & \approx \frac{h}{2} f(a) + h[f(a+h) + f(a+2h) + \dots + f(b-h)] + \frac{h}{2} f(b) \\
    & \approx h[f(a+h) + f(a+2h) + \dots + f(b-h)] + \frac{h}{2} [f(a)+f(b)] \\
    & \approx h[f(a) + f(a+h) + \dots + f(b)] - \frac{h}{2} [f(a)+f(b)] \\
    & \approx h[f(a) + f(a+h) + \dots + f(b-h)] - \frac{h}{2} [f(a)-f(b)] \\
    & \approx h[f(a+h) + f(a+2h) + \dots + f(b)] + \frac{h}{2} [f(a)-f(b)]
\end{aligned}
$$

The proof relies on the fact that *other* than $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, **all other terms are repeated twice**. The last four lines are just different variations that showcase this property:

1. Both $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ excluded from main expression
2. Both $f(a)$ and $f(b)$ included in main expression but subtracted
3. Only $f(a)$ included in main expression; Main expression is a **Left Riemman Sum**
4. Only $f(b)$ included in main expression; Main expression is a **Right Riemman Sum**

<!-- Trapezium Rule -->
![Trapezium Rule](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Trapezium%20Rule.png){.center}

Since the discrete expectation is a right riemann sum, the last expression of the trapezoidal rule should be used. This allows the continuous expectation to be expressed using the discrete expectation, assuming $h=1$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_x
    &= \int^{\infty}_{0} S_x(t) \\
    & \approx h[f(a+h) + f(a+2h) + \dots + f(b)] + \frac{h}{2} [f(a)-f(b)] \\
    & \approx (1) [S_x(1) + S_x(2) + \dots + S_x(\infty)] + \frac{1}{2} [S_x(0)-S_x(\infty)] \\
    & \approx [S_x(1) + S_x(2) + \dots + S_x(\infty)] + \frac{1}{2} [1-0] \\
    & \approx e_x + \frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

An alternative way to view the above is that the area of the trapezoid is the **sum of the riemann rectangles and a triangle**.

### **Euler Maclaurin Formula**

Note that the Trapezoidal Rule is *not perfect* - there is an **inherent error** in trying to approximate a curve using a line.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \int^b_a f(x) & \approx \sum (\text{Area of Trapezium} + \text{Error})\\
\end{aligned}
$$

The error can be positive or negative, depending on the shape of the curve in that interval:

<!-- Obtained from Wikipedia -->
![Trapezoidal Error](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Trapezoidal%20Error.png){.center}

The error term is calculated by taking the difference between the integral and the trapezium, and is generalized using the taylor series. The final result is known as the **Euler Maclaurin Formula**:

$$
    \sum \text{Error} = \frac{h^2}{12} [f'(a)-f'(b)]
$$

\gt Given that a taylor series was used, the error can be expressed as the sum of many different terms, but **higher powers are ignored**.

Thus, the trapezoidal approximation for the expectation can be made more precise:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_x
    & \approx e_x + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1^2}{12} [S'(0)-S'(\infty)] \\
    & \approx e_x + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{12} [S'(0)]
\end{aligned}
$$

The above will rarely be used in this manner - it is more than sufficient to know the relationship between the two expectations of life. However, it sets as a strong foundation to understand the **Woolhouse Approximation** in the life annuities section.

### **Moment Summary**

<!-- Self Made -->
![Moment Summary](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Moment%20Summary.png){.center}

## **Parametric Survival Models**

Given the importance of $\mu_x$, several mathematical functions have been made to describe the force of mortality, known as a **Parametric Survival Model**.

### **Exponential Distribution**

When the **force of mortality is constant** $\mu_{x} = \mu$, the PDF can be shown to be exponential:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_x
    &= e^{- \int^{t}_{0} \mu} \\
    &= e^{- \mu t}\\
    \\
    f(x)
    &= {}_{}p_x \cdot \mu \\
    &= \mu \cdot e^{- \mu t} \\
    \\
    \therefore T_{x} &\sim \text{Exponential}(\mu) \\
    E(T_x) &= \frac{1}{\mu} \\
    Var (T_x) &= \frac{1}{\mu^2}
\end{aligned}
$$

The key is to remember that distribution is **Memoryless**, which means that the **age of the person** does not matter:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n}p_{x} &= {}_{n}p_{x+m} \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{n}p_{x}
    &= {}_{}p_{x} \cdot {}_{}p_{x+1} \cdot {}_{}p_{x+2} \cdot \dots \\
    &= {}_{}p_{x} \cdot {}_{}p_{x} \cdot {}_{}p_{x} \cdot \dots \\
    &= ({}_{}p_{x})^n
\end{aligned}
$$

This leads to an interesting relationship between the full and temporary expectation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mathring{e}_{x} &= \mathring{e}_{x+m} \\
    \\
    \therefore \mathring{e}_x &= \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot \mathring{e}_{x+n} \\
    \mathring{e}_x &= \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} + {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot \mathring{e}_{x} \\
    \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \mathring{e}_x - {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot \mathring{e}_{x} \\
    \mathring{e}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= \mathring{e}_x \cdot (1 - {}_{n}p_{x})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **De Moivre's Model**

**De Moivre's Law** assumes that the **distribution of a NEWBORN** is **uniformly distributed** between 0 and $\omega$, where $\omega$ is known as the **Limiting Age**.

It can be intepreted as starting with $k\omega$ people at age 0, where **$k$ people die every year** till everybody dies by age $w$.

$$
    \ell_{x} = k(\omega - x)
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![De Moivre](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/De%20Moivre.png){.center}

The PDF can be determined using the survival model or the uniform distribution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_x
    &= \frac{\ell_{x+t}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{w-(x+t)}{w-x} \\
    \\
    \mu_{x+t}
    &= \frac{1}{w-(x+t)} \\
    \\
    \therefore f(x)
    &= \frac{w-(x+t)}{w-x} \cdot \frac{1}{w-(x+t)} \\
    &= \frac{1}{\omega-x}
\end{aligned}
$$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    T_{0} &\sim \text{Uniform}(0, \omega) \\
    T_{x} &= T_{0} - x \mid T_{0} \gt x \\
    \therefore T_{x} &\sim \text{Uniform}(0, \omega-x) \\
    \\
    E(T_{x}) &= \frac{\omega-x}{2} \\
    Var(T_{x}) &= \frac{(\omega-x)^2}{12}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Gompertz Model**

Both the above distributions make unrealistic assumptions:

1. **Exponential Distribution**: Assume age does not matter
2. **Uniform Distribution**: Assume equal number of people die eacg tear

A more realistic model is the **Gompertz Model**, which suggests that **mortality increases with age**:

$$
    \mu_{x} = Bc^{x} \\
$$

Thus, the corresponding survival function can be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_{x}
    &= e^{-\int^{n}_{0} Bc^{x+s}} \\
    &= e^{-Bc^{x} \int^{n}_{0} c^{s}} \\
    &= e^{-Bc^{x} [\frac{c^s}{\ln c}]^t_0} \\
    &= e^{-Bc^{x} [\frac{c^t}{\ln c} - \frac{c^0}{\ln c}]} \\
    &= e^{\frac{-Bc^{x}}{\ln c} (c^t - 1)}
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Makeham Gompertz Model**

Makeham added a **constant** $A$ into the Gompertz model, resulting in the **Makeham Gompertz Model**:

$$
    \mu_{x} = A + B \cdot c^{x}
$$

$A$ represents the **age independent mortality** - dying from reasons unrelated to age, such as from accidents or natural catastrophes.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S_x(t)
    &= e^{- \int^{t}_{0} A + Bc^{x+t}} \\
    &= e^{\int^{t}_{0} -A - Bc^{x+t}} \\
    &= e^{\left[-At - \frac{B}{\ln c} c^{x+t} \right]^{t}_{0}} \\
    &= e^{\left[-At - \frac{B}{\ln c} c^{x+t} \right] - \left[-\frac{B}{\ln c} c^{x} \right]} \\
    &= e^{-At - \frac{B}{\ln c} c^{x+t} + \frac{B}{\ln c} c^{x}} \\
    &= e^{-At - \frac{B}{\ln c} c^{x} [c^t - 1]} \\
    &= e^{-At} \cdot e^{- \frac{B}{\ln c} c^{x} [c^{t} - 1]}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    If the force of mortality provided follow a *similar* expression as above, **immediately recognize** that this is the makeham gompertz model.

    **Do NOT waste time** attempting to integrate the force; simply use the formula provided in the formula sheet to calculate the probabilities.

Any modification made to the force should be expressed as a change in the Makeham parameters:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu_{x} &= A + B \cdot c^{x} \\
    \\
    \mu_{y} &= \mu_{x} + Z \\
    \therefore \mu_{y} &= (A+Z) + B \cdot c^{x} \\
    \\
    \mu_{Z} &= \mu_{x} + Z \cdot B \cdot c^{x} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Population Mortality**

The Makeham Gompertz Model is ideal because it depicts human mortality fairly accurately:

<!-- Population Mortality -->
![Population Mortality](Assets/1.%20Survival%20Models.md/Population%20Mortality.png){.center}

There are a few key aspects to take note of:

* **Gender Difference**: Males have higher mortality
* **Perinatal Mortality**: Infants with birth issues likely to die, mortality decreases after
* **Accident Hump**: Mortality increases past age 10, more sharply in males due to accidents
