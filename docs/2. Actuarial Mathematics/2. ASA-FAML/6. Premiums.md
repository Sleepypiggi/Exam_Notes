# **Premiums**

## **Overview**

Unlike other products, the cost of a Life Assurance or Annuity are not known when it is issued, as it is **impossible to precisely predict** when an individual will die or how long they will live for.

Premiums are the amount that the insurance company charges for a Life Assurance or Annuity. They aim to charge a sufficiently high premium such that they expect to at least **break even** on the sale of the policy on an **EPV basis**.

There are three main types of premiums:

<center>

| Single Premium | Limited Premium | Regular Premium |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| Single Lump Sum | Recurring for a fixed period | Recurring as long as the contract is valid |
| Use dollar amount | Modelled using TA Annuities | Modelled using WL Annuities |

</center>

!!! Info

    Premiums can be **paid at any frequency**, but monthly is the most common as it matches the frequency of when people receive their income.

    They are always **paid in advance**. If they were paid in arrears, policyholders may refuse to pay premiums on the **flawed grounds** that since they did not die, they did not utilize the coverage and hence should not pay.

There are two types of premiums that can be calculated:

* **Net Premiums ($P$)** - *Excluding* expenses; benefits only
* **Gross Premiums ($G$)** - *Including* expenses and other cashflows

The key thing to notice is that the components of net premiums are fixed while gross premiums differ from insurer to insurer. Thus, this section will **only show formulas for net premiums**.

## **Equivalence Principle Approach**

To determine the breakeven point of the insurer, the **Loss Amount** must first be defined. It is the net outflow of the policy:

$$
    \text{Loss} = \text{Outflow} - \text{Inflow}
$$

Let ${}_{t-1}L_{x}$ be the random variable denoting the PV of the loss at the **START of policy year t**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t-1}L_{x}
    &= \text{PV Outflow} - \text{PV Inflows} \\
    &= B \cdot v^{K_{x+(t-1)} + 1} - P \cdot \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x+(t-1)} + 1}}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Loss Timing](Assets/6.%20Premiums.md/Loss%20Timing.png){.center}

Since L represents an outflow rather than an inflow, its **intepretation is reversed**: 

* ${}_{t-1}L_{x} \gt 0$, Negative Profits (Losing money)
* ${}_{t-1}L_{x} \lt 0$, Positive Profits (Making money)

Intuitively, insurers will charge a premium such that they **expect to break even at the time of the sale**, time 0. In other words, the **expected loss at the start of the policy year 1 is 0**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{0}L_{x}
    &= B \cdot v^{K_{x} + 1} - P \cdot \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x} + 1}} \\
    \\
    E \left({}_{0}L_{x} \right)
    &= B \cdot E \left(v^{K_{x} + 1} \right)
        - P \cdot E \left(\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x} + 1}} \right) \\
    &= B \cdot A_{x} - P \cdot \ddot{a}_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore
    E \left({}_{0}L_{x} \right) &= 0 \\
    B \cdot A_{x} - P \cdot \ddot{a}_x &= 0 \\
    P \cdot \ddot{a}_{x} &= B \cdot A_{x} \\
    P &= B \cdot \frac{A_x}{\ddot{a}_x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    For the purposes of this exam, premiums are usually **paid annually**, where $P$ represents the **annual net premium**.

    If premiums were paid more frequently, then the corresponding EPVs should be used:

    $$
        \text{EPV Inflow} = P \cdot \ddot{a}^{(m)}_{x}
    $$

    Regardless of the frequency of payment, the **annual net premium** is still multiplied the EPVs.

    Thus, to obtain the **premium payable per period** (vice-versa) the annual premium must be divided by the number of periods.

    $$
        P^{(m)} = \frac{P}{m}
    $$

    Premiums can also be paid continuously. The amount paid continuously is known as the **Premium Rate** -- it does not follow the above convention.

This is known as the **Equivalence Principle** approach, as it charges premiums such that the EPVs of the inflows and outflows are equal:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Outflow} &= \text{EPV Inflow} \\
    \text{EPV Premium} &= \text{EPV Benefit}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    If the policy charges a **Single Net Premium** using the equivalence principle, then that is simply equivalent to the EPV of the benefits.

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{EPV Premium} &= \text{Single Net Premium} \\
        \therefore \text{Single Net Premium} &= \text{EPV Benefit}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

## **Portfolio Percentile Approach**

The equivalence principle calculates the premium for a **single policy** such that it is **expected to break even**.

Given a **portfolio of N homogenous policies**, the **Portfolio Percentile Approach** can be used to calculate the premims such that the probability that the **entire portfolio at least breaks even** is fixed at some minimum value.

Let $S$ be the random variable denoting the **aggregate loss** of $N$ homogenous policies that were **just issued**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S &= {}_{0}L_1 + {}_{0}L_2 + \dots + {}_{0}L_{N} \\
    E(S) &= N \cdot E({}_{0}L) \\
    Var (S) &= N \cdot \text{Var}({}_{0}L)
\end{aligned}
$$

The expectation and variance of a single policy can be determined as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{0}L
    &= B \cdot v^{K_{x} + 1} - P \cdot \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{K_{x} + 1}} \\
    &= B \cdot v^{K_{x} + 1} - P \cdot \frac{1- v^{K_{x} + 1}}{d} \\
    &= B \cdot v^{K_{x} + 1} + \frac{- P + P v^{K_{x} + 1}}{d} \\
    &= \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)v^{K_{x} + 1} - \frac{P}{d} \\
    \\
    E({}_{0}L)
    &= E \left[\left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)v^{K_{x} + 1} - \frac{P}{d} \right] \\
    &= \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right) E(v^{K_{x} + 1}) - E \left(\frac{P}{d} \right) \\
    &= \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)A_{x}  - \frac{P}{d} \\
    \\
    \text{Var}({}_{0}L)
    &= \text{Var}\left[\left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)v^{K_{x} + 1} - \frac{P}{d} \right] \\
    &= \text{Var} \left[\left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)v^{K_{x} + 1}  \right] \\
    &= \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)^2 \cdot \text{Var} \left(v^{K_{x} + 1} \right) \\
    &= \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)^2 \cdot \left[{}^{2}A_{x} - (A_{x})^2 \right]
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to mix this up with the variance of the policy benefits.

!!! Tip

    Notice that the EPV components of the mean and variance are only based on the policyholder's age.

    Thus, different policies (with different benefits and premiums) can be used to solve for these **shared EPV components** and hence calculate the mean and variance of each policy.

If $N$ is sufficiently large, then $S$ is **approximately normally distributed** via the central limit theorem:

$$
    S \sim N(E(S), \text{Var}(S))
$$

The premium is then set such the **probability of at least breaking even** (probability of profit) is set a pre-determined level $\alpha$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(S < 0) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(\frac{S - E(S)}{\sqrt{Var (S)}} \le \frac{0 - E(S)}{\sqrt{Var (S)}}\right) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(Z \le \frac{- E(S)}{\sqrt{Var (S)}}\right) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(Z \le \frac{- n \cdot E({}_{0}L)}{\sqrt{n \cdot Var ({}_{0}L)}}\right) &= \alpha \\
    P\left(Z \le \frac{- n \cdot E({}_{0}L)}{\sqrt{n \cdot Var ({}_{0}L)}}\right) &= \alpha \\
    \\
    \frac{- n \cdot E({}_{0}L)}{\sqrt{n \cdot Var ({}_{0}L)}} = Z_{\alpha}
\end{aligned}
$$

By plugging in the values determined earlier and solving for P, the appropriate premiums can be determined.

## **Loss Probability**

The above method can also be **used in reverse** - given a premium, the probability that the **aggregate loss** taking on some range of values can be computed.

For a **single policy**, the probability must be solved using the survival distribution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P({{}_{0}L} \gt k)
    &= P \left( \left(B + \frac{P}{d} \right)v^{K_{x} + 1} - \frac{P}{d} \gt k \right) \\
    &= \dots \\
    &= P(K_x \gt \dots)
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Gross Premiums**

What makes gross premiums so much trickier than net premiums is that there are many **different types of expenses**, where every question can ask for a unique combination of them.

!!! Tip

    Questions will **explicitly state** if there are expenses in the policy. Just because a question uses "Gross Premiums" does not automatically mean that there are expenses.

Expenses can be differentiated in terms of **when they are charged**:

<center>

| **Acquisition Expenses** | **Renewal Expenses** | **Termination Expense** |
| :-: | :-: | :-: |
| At policy **inception** | During policy **lifetime** | At policy **termination** |
| Single payment at **time 0** | Recurring payments from **time 1** onwards | Single payment at unknown time |
| Denoted by $e_0$ | Denoted by $e_t$ | Denoted by $E$ |
| Raw Value | **Annuity** Functions | **Assurance** Function |
| EG. Commissions expenses | EG. Administrative Expenses | EG. Claims expenses |

</center>

!!! Warning

    Renewal Expenses is also sometimes known as **Maintenance Expenses**.

    Although they are usually charged from policy year 2 onwards, they **can be charged in the first year as well**. The above table is just a general guide.

Acquisition expenses are usually higher than renewal ones as agent commissions are mostly front-loaded in the first year to give agents cash faster, incentivizing them to sell more.

!!! Note

    Renewal Expenses can also **inflate** over time, where they increase by a factor of $(1+r)$ each year. In this case, they are modelled using a **geometrically increasing annuity** instead.

They can also be differentiated in terms of **how much they charge**:

<center>

| **Overhead Expenses** | **Direct Expenses** |
| :-: | :-: |
| Shared among all policies | Borne by a specific policy |
| **Fixed** amount | **Percentage** of Premium or Benefit |
| EG. Office Rental | EG. Sales Commission |

</center>

!!! Tip
    
    Generally speaking, bverhead expenses are charged every year while direct expenses are only charged whenever premiums are paid.

    This is relevant for policies for with a **limited payment period**. After the premium payment period, only overhead expenses are charged to the policy.

    Similarly, if premiums are payable $m$ times a year, then **expenses are payable $m$ times a year as well**.

Gross premiums can also include **other cashflows**, such as a pre-determined **profit margin**. Since these are highly dependent on context, they will NOT be covered in this section.

### **Level Expenses**

Acquisition and Renewal Expenses are always assumed to be paid at the **beginning of the period**, unless stated otherwise:

<!-- Self Made -->
![Expense Cashflows](Assets/6.%20Premiums.md/Expense%20Cashflows.png){.center}

Since the renewal expenses only occur at the **beginning of year 2**, they can be equivalently thought of as occuring at the **end of year 1** and every subsequent year after. Thus, it can be modelled using an **annuity immediate**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Expenses}
    &= e_0 + e_t \cdot a_x \\
    &= e_0 + e_t \cdot (\ddot{a}_{x} - 1)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note
    
    This simplification **does NOT hold true if there is expense inflation** -  the level annuity immediate CANNOT simply be replaced with the geometric annuity.

    This is because the expenses only start to inflate from the third payment onwards:

    <!-- Self Made -->
    ![Expense Inflation](Assets/6.%20Premiums.md/Expense%20Inflation.png){.center}

If expenses are charged at the **end of the year, including the year of death**, then an **assurance** must be used on top of an annuity immediate.

This is because an annuity always **assumes that the individual is alive** at the time that the cashflows occur. Thus, the expense of the year of death can be thought of as a **termination expense equal to the renewal expenses**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Expenses} 
    &= \text{EPV Renewal Expense} + \text{EPV Termination Expense} \\
    &= e_t \cdot a_{x} + e_t \cdot A_{x} \\
    &= e_t \cdot (a_{x} + A_{x})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Non-Level Expenses**

Expenses may also be **non-level**, typically decreasing throughout the lifetime of the policy: 

<!-- Obtained from SOA FAML Sample Questions -->
![Non Level Expenses](Assets/6.%20Premiums.md/Non%20Level%20Expenses.png){.center}

If mortality follows the SULT, then the various EPVs can be easily calculated. Thus, the EPV of expenses can be directly calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Expenses}
    &= 60 + 0.8G  \\
    &+ (30 + 0.2G) (\ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{15}} - 1) \\
    &+ ({}_{15}E_{x})(30 + 0.1G)(\ddot{a}_{x+15:\enclose{actuarial}{15}} - 1) \\
    &+ ({}_{30}E_{x})(30)(\ddot{a}_{x+30} - 1)
\end{aligned}
$$

However, if the various EPVs cannot be obtained, then the cashflows must the simplified by **splitting them into shared components**:

<!-- Self Made -->
![Expense Splitting](Assets/6.%20Premiums.md/Expense%20Splitting.png){.center}

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Expenses}
    &= 30 \cdot \ddot{a}_{x} \\
    &+ 0.1G \cdot \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{30}} \\
    &+ 0.1G \cdot \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{15}} \\
    &+ 0.6G
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    This is the **preferred method** of calculating the EPV of expenses when dealing with multiple expense tiers.

### **Expense Premiums**

The difference between the gross and net premiums represent the premium needed to **cover just the expenses**. It is known as the **Expense Loading**, as it represents the amoount **loaded onto the net premiums for expenses**.

!!! Info

    A **front-end load** is an expense load placed at cashflows at inception while a **back-end load** is placed at termination.

Since it is still a premium, the **equivalance principle** still applies to it:

$$
    \text{EPV Expense Loading} = \text{EPV Expenses}
$$

Intuitively, it is the **difference between the gross and net premium**:

$$
    G^E = G - P
$$

## **Return of Premiums**

Some policies offer a **Return of Premium** (ROP) feature where the death benefit is increased by the total amount of **premiums paid till that point**.

These ROP features are usually in effect for a **limited period of time** or when premiums are paid for a limited period of time.

### **Without Interest**

If the premiums are paid back **without interest**, then the ROP benefits are akin to an **arithmetically increasing annuity**:

$$
    \text{EPV ROP} = P \cdot (IA)^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->

!!! Info

    This is the main way (if at all) that variable benefit assurances and annuities are tested. Thus, it is recommended to **memorize just this subsection** rather than go through the entire section on variable benefits.

Since it not possible to calculate $(IA)_{x}$ from the SULT, the question **must provide** values to help compute it. This can be done in one of two ways:

1. Provide EPV of an increasing whole life assurance at different ages
2. Provide EPV of a decreasing term assurance

$$
\begin{aligned}
    (IA)^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= (IA)_x - {}_{n}E_x [(IA)_{x+n} + nA_{x+n}] \\
    &= (n+1)A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - (D_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}A)^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The EPV of a decreasing term assurance can also be represented by:

    $$
        (D_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}A)^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
        = \sum^{n}_{k=1} A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{k}}
    $$

    This is better understood visually:

    <!-- Self Made -->
    ![Decreasing Assurance](Assets/6.%20Premiums.md/Decreasing%20Assurance.png){.center}

### **With Interest**

If the premiums are paid back with interest, then we need to find the **accumulated value** of the premiums at every point, and then **discount them back to their present values**.

By visualizing the cashflows, we can see that the accumulated value of the premiums can be represented by the **accumulated value of an annuity due**, $\ddot{s}$:

<!-- Self Made -->
![ROP with Interest](Assets/6.%20Premiums.md/ROP%20with%20Interest.png){.center}

!!! Warning

    It is a common misconception to think that an annuity immediate should be used, because the death cashflows occur at the end of the period.

    However, it is key to understand that the annuities look at the raw cashflows, not the ones accumulated with interest.

The PV of these accumulated annuities can be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{PV ROP}
    &= P(\ddot{s}_{\enclose{actuarial}{1}} \cdot v^{1} + \ddot{s}_{\enclose{actuarial}{2}} \cdot v^{2} + \dots + \ddot{s}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \cdot v^{n}) \\
    &= P \cdot \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} \ddot{s}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} \cdot v^{k+1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, their EPVs can be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV ROP}
    &= P \cdot \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} \ddot{s}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} \cdot v^{k+1} {}_{k \mid}q_{x} \\
    &= P \cdot \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} \frac{(1+i)^{k+1} - 1}{d} \cdot v^{k+1} {}_{k \mid}q_{x} \\
    &= \frac{P}{d} \cdot \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} (1 - v^{k+1}) \cdot {}_{k \mid}q_{x} \\
    &= \frac{P}{d} \cdot \left(\sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} {}_{k \mid}q_{x} - \sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} v^{k+1} {}_{k \mid}q_{x} \right) \\
    &= \frac{P}{d} \cdot \left({}_{n}q_{x} - A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is easy to confuse the above term $(\sum^{n-1}_{k = 0} {}_{k \mid}q_{x})$ with the discrete expectation:

    $$
        E(X) = \sum k \cdot {}_{k \mid}q_{x}
    $$

    The key difference is that the discrete expectation is multiplied by $k$, which causes to reduce to the survival probability.

    Without it, as like above, it simply reduces to the probability of dying during the period.
