# **Variable Benefits**

## **Overview**

Previously, the benefit of the assurances were assumed to be **fixed at 1** for simplicity. In practice, it is common to have assurances where the benefits **change over time**.

The content for this section has rarely been tested and thus can be skimmed through for the purposes of this exam.

## **Geometric Contracts**

If the benefits change by a **common factor** each period, then it is known as a **Geometric** contract.

The benefit of the policy **starts at 1** in the first year and **changes by $(1+b)$** each period:

* If $b>0$, then the benefits are **increasing**
* If $b<0$, then the benefits are **decreasing**

$$
    \text{Geometric Benefit} = (1+b)^{K_x}
$$

> Note that the power is $K_x$ and NOT $K_x+1$ to reflect that the benefit **starts at 1** when $K_x=0$.

### **Geometric Assurance**

Let $\text{Geom WL}$ be the random variable denoting the PV of a Geometric Assurance.

$$
    \text{Geom WL} = (1+b)^{K_x} v^{K_x+1}
$$

Thus, the EPV of a WL Geometric Assurance can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Geom WL}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} (1+b)^{k} v^{k+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    &= (1+b)^{-1} \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} (1+b)^{k+1} v^{k+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    &= \frac{1}{1+b} \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} \left(\frac{1+b}{1+i}\right)^{k+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    &= \frac{1}{1+b} \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} (v')^{k+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    &= \frac{1}{1+b} A_x |_{i=\frac{1+i}{1+b}-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that this means that the term $A_x |_{i=\frac{1+i}{1+b}-1}$ by *itself* is a Geometric Assurance that **starts with payments of $(1+b)$**, which is why $\frac{1}{1+b}$ is required to scale it down by one factor such that it starts at one.

In practice, most questions will provide a value of $b$ such that $(i=\frac{1+i}{1+b}-1)$ simplifies to a **nice percentage**. However, this usually means that the value of $b$ provided is some complicated number, so do not be taken aback!

The expression follows similar intuition to the second moment - it is simply a regular EPV expression evaluated at a **different interest rate**. Unfortunately, there is **no specified actuarial notation** for this niche case. One common approach is to denote it using $A_x^i$.

### **Geometric Annuity**

Let $\text{EPV Geom WL}_\text{Due}$ be the random variable denoting the PV of a Geometric Annuity Due.

<!-- No general expression? -->

Thus, the EPV of a Geometric Annuity Due can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Geom WL}_\text{Due}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} (1+c)^k v^k {}_{k}p_x \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} \left(\frac{1+c}{1+i}\right)^k {}_{k}p_x \\
    &= \ddot{a}_x|_{i = \frac{1+i}{1+c}-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- What about Geometric Term? -->

### **Continuous Geometric**

The EPV of continuously payable geometric contracts can be calculated using the usual UDD, Claims Acceleration or Woolhouse Approximations.

However, despite having a "new" interest rate, the **original interest rate** is used in the continuous approximation parameters.

!!! Warning

    This is **different** from the second moment where the new interest rate must be reflected in the approximation as well. Take note of the different treatments.

## **Arithmetic Contracts**

If the benefits change by a **fixed constant** each period, then it is instead known as an **Arithmetic** contract.

For simplicity, the change each period is assumed to be 1:

* **Arithmetically Increasing** - Increases by 1 each period
* **Arithmetically Decreasing** - Decreased by 1 each period

Since a WL contract lasts forever, the benefits of a decreasing WL contract would **inevitably become negative**, which do not make sense. Thus, WLs can only be **arithmetically increasing contracts**.

$$
    \text{Arithmetically Increasing Benefit} = K_x + 1
$$

### **Arithmetic Assurance**

Let $\text{Arith WL}$ be the random variable denoting the PV of an arithmetically increasing WL Assurance:

$$
    \text{Arith WL} = (K_x + 1) v^{K_x+1}
$$

Thus, the EPV of a WL Arithmetic Assurance can be shown to be:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Arith WL} &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} (k+1) v^{k+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    (IA)_x &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} (k+1) v^{k+1} {}_{k|}q_x
\end{aligned}
$$

$(IA)_x$ is the actuarial notation for the EPV of a contract with arithmetically increasing benefits **starting at 1** and **increasing by 1** each period.

It can also be shown to be a **sum of deferred WLs**, each deferred by one period from the previous. This creates a **step-like benefit** which creates the increasing effect of the assurance:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    (IA)_x
    &= {}_{0|}A_x + {}_{1|}A_x + {}_{2|}A_x + ... \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{K_x = 0} {}_{K_x|}A_x
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Arithmetic Deferred](Assets/5.%20Variable%20Benefits.md/Arithmetic%20Deferred.png){.center}

In practice, the magnitude of the change is *unlikely* to be one. Thus, the EPV must be **scaled** to match the actual change. This can be **problematic** if the starting benefit is **NOT the same as the change**.

Consider a product with benefit $B$ that increases by $k$ each year. Due to the definition of the IWL variable, the starting benefit and change each period are equal - we **cannot simply multiply** $B$ or $k$ to the IWL EPV.

Thus, we must split this product into a **fixed component** with $B-k$ benefits and a **variable component** that starts and increases by $k$ each period. The sum of these two components results in a benefit of $B, B+k, B+2k, \dots$

### **Arithmetic Annuities**

Let $\text{Arith WL}_\text{Due}$ be the random variable denoting the PV of an arithmetically increasing annuity.

The PV can be denoted by an arithmetically increasing annuity *certain*:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Arith WL}_\text{Due}
    &= (I\ddot{a})_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{k=0} v^k \cdot \ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n-k}} \\
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{k=0} v^k \cdot \frac{1-v^{n-k}}{d} \\
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{k=0} \frac{v^k - v^n}{d} \\
    &= \frac{1}{d} \left(\sum^{n-1}_{k=0} v^k - \sum^{n-1}_{k=0} v^n \right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{d} (\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - nv^n) \\
    &= \frac{\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - nv^n}{d}
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Increasing Annuity Certain](Assets/5.%20Variable%20Benefits.md/Increasing%20Annuity%20Certain.png){.center}

Similarly, the EPV of an arithmetically increasing WL annuity Due can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Arith WL}_\text{Due} &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} (I\ddot{a})_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} \cdot {}_{k|}q_x \\
    (I\ddot{a})_x &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} (k+1) v^k {}_{k}p_x \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Alternatively, it can be calculated from an assurance instead:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Arith WL}_\text{Due} &= \frac{\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}} - (k+1)v^{k+1}}{d} \\
    E(\text{Arith WL}_\text{Due}) &= \frac{E(\ddot{a}_{\enclose{actuarial}{k+1}}) - E((k+1)v^{k+1})}{d} \\
    (I\ddot{a})_x &= \frac{\ddot{a}_x - (IA)_x}{d}
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that the main difference between an increasing annuity **due and immediate** is that the immediate case now **lags** the due by 1 **every period**. This difference can be accounted for using a level annuity due:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    (I\ddot{a})_x
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} (k+1) v^k {}_{k}p_{x} \\
    &= v^{0} {}_{0}p_{x} + 2v^{1} {}_{1}p_{x} + 3v^{2} {}_{2}p_{x} + \dots \\
    &= (v^{1} {}_{1}p_{x} + 2v^{2} {}_{2}p_{x} + \dots) + (v^{0} {}_{0}p_{x} + v^{1} {}_{1}p_{x} + v^{2} {}_{2}p_{x} + \dots) \\
    &= (Ia)_x + \ddot{a}_x \\
    (Ia)_x &= (I\ddot{a})_x - \ddot{a}_x
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Increasing Due Immediate](Assets/5.%20Variable%20Benefits.md/Increasing%20Due%20Immediate.png){.center}

### **Arithmetic Term/Temporary**

For contract with *level benefits*, term/temporary contracts can be expressed as a **difference of two WLs** issued at different times because the benefits for the time after the specified term would *cancel out*.

For contracts with variable benefits, this is slightly more complicated as the benefits after the specified term **do NOT cancel out**:

* The "earlier" WL would have increased significantly from its starting value
* The "later" WL would only be at its starting value

Thus, an additional expression needs to be subtracted in order to **remove the remaining benefit** past the specified term. This can be done using a **level benefit contract** with the a benefit **equal to the remaining amount**.

Thus, the EPV of an **Increasing Term Assurance** can be calculated as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Arith TA} &= \sum^{n-1}_{K_x=0} (k+1) v^{K_x+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    (IA)^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= (IA)_x - {}_{n}E_x [(IA)_{x+n} + nA_{x+n}]
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Increasing Term](Assets/5.%20Variable%20Benefits.md/Increasing%20Term.png)

Thus, the EPV of an **Increasing Term Annuity** can be calculated as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Arith TA}_\text{Due} &= \sum^{n-1}_{k=0} (I\ddot{a})_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \cdot {}_{k|}q_x \\
    (I\ddot{a})_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{k=0} (k+1) v^k {}_{k}p_x \\
    &= (I\ddot{a})_x - {}_{n}E_x[(I\ddot{a})_{x+n}+n\ddot{a}_{x+n}]
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note "Due to Immediate Conversion"

    As mentioned in the Life Annuity section, it is not useful to memorize the conversion from Due to Immediate for TAs. Thus, simply express the ITA in the form of IWLs and then perform the conversion there.

#### **Decreasing Benefits**

As mentioned previously, another key feature of term/temporary contracts is that they can have **decreasing benefits**.

This is because the benefit of the policy can be set such that it would **exactly decrease to 0** by the end of the policy term. This is done by setting a **starting benefit of $n$ and decreasing by $1$ each period**:

$$
    \text{Arithmetically Decreasing Benefit} = n-k
$$

Thus, the EPV of a **Decreasing Term Assurance** can be calculated as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Arith Decreasing TA} &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} (n-k) v^{k+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    (D_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}A)_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} (n-k+1-1) v^{k+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    &= \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} (n+1) v^{k+1} {}_{k|}q_x - \sum^{\infty}_{k=0} (k+1) v^{k+1} {}_{k|}q_x \\
    &= (n+1)A^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - (IA)^1_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
\end{aligned}
$$

$(DA)$ is the actuarial notation for an Assurance with *Arithmetically decreasing* benefits **starting at $n$** and **decreasing by 1** each period.

<!-- Self Made -->
![Decreasing Term](Assets/5.%20Variable%20Benefits.md/Decreasing%20Term.png){.center}

Similarly, the EPV of a decreasing temporary annuity can be calculated as the following:

$$
    (D_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}}\ddot{a})_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
    = (n+1)\ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} - (I\ddot{a})_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}
$$

### **Continuous Arithmetic**

Similar to Geometric Contracts, the EPV of a continuously payable Arithmetic Contracts can be calculated using the usual approximations.

However, take note that for TAs, the **added term should also be continuous**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    (I\bar{A})_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= (I\bar{A})_x - {}_{n}E_x[(I\bar{A})_{x+n}+ n\bar{A}_{x+n}] \\
    (I\bar{a})_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} &= (I\bar{a})_x - {}_{n}E_x[(I\bar{a})_{x+n}+ n\bar{a}_{x+n}]
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note "Increasing Woolhouse Approximation"

    For IWL Annuities, the woolhouse approximation is slightly different:

    $$
        (I\bar{a})_{x} = (I\ddot{a})_{x} - \frac{1}{2} \ddot{a}_x
    $$

Continuous arithmetic contracts could *also* refer to a contract that not only payable continuously, but **changes continuously** as well. The benefits change at a **constant rate throughout the period**, such that the total change is still equal to 1.

For **Assurances**, it can be understood from a graphical approach:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    (\bar{I}\bar{A})_{x} &= (I\bar{A})_{x} - \frac{1}{2} \bar{A}_x
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Continuously Variable](Assets/5.%20Variable%20Benefits.md/Continuously%20Variable.png){.center}

For Annuities, it can be derived using the **woolhouse approximation**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    (\bar{I}\bar{a})_x
    &= (Ia)_x + \frac{1}{12} \\
    &= (I\ddot{a})_x - \ddot{a}_x + \frac{1}{12}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that these approximations are **ONLY applicable for WL policies**. For continously increasing TAs, **convert them to WLs first** before applying the approximations.

## **Variable Recursions**

Since the benefit payable at the end of the first year is **still 1**, the recursion for variable contracts are similar to the level ones.

### **Variable Assurances**

Consider the two scenarios:

* If the policyholder dies in the current year with probability $q_x$, then a **benefit of 1** is paid at the end of the year
* If the policyholder lives past the current year with probability $p_x$, then the they will receive the EPV of a policy with benefits $2, 3, \dots$ or $(1+b)^1, (1+b)^2, \dots$ at some future time

The second component must be the EPV of an assurance that **STARTS with an increased benefit** of $(1+b)$ or $2$. The issue is that the random variable is currently defined as a contract with benefits *starting at 1*, which is why the recursive formula is **different from the level case**.

For Geometric Assurances, $A_{x+1}|_{i=\frac{1+i}{1+b}-1}$ is **already** an Geometric Assurance that starts at $(1+b)$, thus no adjustment is needed for the RHS:

$$
    \text{EPV Geom WL}_{x} = vq_x + vp_x A_{x+1}|_{i=\frac{1+i}{1+b}-1}
$$

For Arithmetic Assurances, an EPV representing an **additional benefit of 1 each period** must be added to the second component so that the RHS expression starts from 2 and increases by an additional 1 each period.

$$
    (IA)_{x} = vq_x + vp_x[(IA)_{x+1} + A_{x+1}]
$$

### **Variable Annuities**

Recall that a **benefit of 1 is already received at the beginning of the year** regardless of whether the policyholder lives or dies.

* If the policyholder dies with probability $q_x$, then they receive nothing extra
* If the policyholder lives past the current year with probability $p_x$, then they will receive benefits that are **larger than 1** at some future time

For Geometric Annuities, TBC.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Geom WL}_{\text{Due},x} = 1 + vp_x \cdot (1+c) \left(\ddot{a}_{x+1}|_{i = \frac{1+i}{1+c}-1} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

For Arithmetic Annuities, the same adjustment as before must be made:

$$
    (I\ddot{a})_x = 1 + vp_x[(I\ddot{a})_{x+1} + \ddot{a}_{x+1}]
$$

### **In Force Recursions**

Previously, we have only considered the EPV for a **newly issued policy** at age $x$. However, now we want to consider the EPV of a policy that has **already been in force** for some period of time $t$.

For policies with **level benefits**, the EPV of an already in force policy is exactly the **same as the EPV of a newly issued policy** at the current age with the **same expiration date**. This means that the **same recursion** can be used for both newly issued policies and inforce policies.

However, this is NOT the case for policies with **variable benefits** as the inforce policy would have a benefit of $t$ or $(1+b)^{t-1}$ while a newly issued policy would have benefit of 1. This means that a **seperate recursion** must be defined for inforce variable policies.

For simplicity, we will consider an in force **arithmetically increasing WL Assurance**:

* If the policyholder dies with probability $q_{x+t-1}$, they will receive a benefit of $t$ at the end of the year
* If the poliycholder survives with probability $p_{x+t-1}$, they will receive the EPV of a contract with benefits $t+1, t+2, \dots$ at some future time

$$
    RHS = vq_{x+t-1} \cdot t + vp_{x+t-1} [(IA)_{x+t} + tA_{x+t}]
$$

Since (IA) is used to denote a policy with benefits starting at 1, an **additional term must be added to the LHS** to show that the in force policy has benefits of t:

$$
    LHS = (IA)_{x+t-1} + (t-1) A_{x+t-1}
$$

The same exercise can be performed for Annuities as well, resulting in the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    (IA)_{x+t-1} + (t-1) A_{x+t-1} &= vq_{x+t-1} \cdot t + vp_{x+t-1} [(IA)_{x+t} + tA_{x+t}] \\
    (I\ddot{a})_{x+t-1} + (t-1) \ddot{a}_{x+t-1} &= t + vp_{x+t-1} [(I\ddot{a})_{x+t} + t\ddot{a}_{x+t}]
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning "Term/Temporary Policies"

    The same can be shown for Variable Term/Temporary policies, but remember that the **remaining duration of the policy must decrease** as well.
