# **Life Tables**

## **Overview**

A **Life Table** is a convenient way of summarizing the results of the survival model. As such, they are equivalent ways of obtaining the same results.

## **Basic Functions**

The life table is constructed based on the mortality of a **homogenous group of people** known as the **Cohort**.

!!! Info

    In practice, multiple life tables are created for different groups of individuals with different risks (Male vs Female, Smoker vs Non Smoker).

The **initial age** of the group people is known as the **Starting Age**, denoted by $\alpha$. The **initial number** of people in the cohort is known as the **Radix**, which is usually a large round number (EG. 1000).

Conversely, the maximum age is known as the **Limiting Age**, denoted by $\omega$. Everybody in the cohort is expected to gradually **die by the terminal age**.

The **expected number** of people who are alive at age $x$ is denoted as $\ell_x$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \ell_0 &= 1000 \\
    \ell_{\omega} &= 0 \\
    \\
    \therefore \ell_{x+t} &< \ell_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

From this basic life table, several important values can be calculated:

1. The **expected number of deaths** over a period, ${}_{n}d_{x}$
2. The probability of **survival** past a period, ${}_{n}p_{x}$
3. The probability of **death** within a period, ${}_{n}q_{x}$
4. The **deferred** probability of death within a period, ${}_{s|t}q_{x}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n}d_{x} &= \ell_{x} - \ell_{x+n} \\
    {}_{n}p_{x} &= \frac{\ell_{x+t}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    {}_{n}q_{x} &= \frac{{}_{n}d_{x}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    {}_{s|t}q_{x} &= \frac{{}_{t}d_{x+s}}{l_{x}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, it can be seen that the probabilities are calculated from first principles as the **proportion of people** who died/survived over the a given period.

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake when calculating the number of deaths to take the number of survivors at the higher age minus the lower age. This is because we intuitively think "high minus low".

    However, since the number of survivors is a decreasing function, it should be the other way around!

### **Binomial Distribution**

Intuitively, each person in the cohort can either be **Alive or Dead**. Thus, their status can be represented by a **Bernoulli Variable**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Status}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        0 \ (\text{Dead}),& {}_{n}q_{x} \\
        1 \ (\text{Alive}),& {}_{n}p_{x}
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

Assuming that the lifetimes of each person in the cohort is independent of one another, the total number of people alive is the **sum of independent bernoulli variables**, thus is **binomially distributed**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \ell_{t} &\sim \text{Binomial}(\ell_0, {}_{n}p_{x}) \\
    \\
    E(N) &= \ell_0 \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \\
    Var(N) &= \ell_0 \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot (1-{}_{n}p_{x}) \\
    \\
    \therefore \ell_{x} &= E(N)
\end{aligned}
$$

Given a sufficiently large population, the binomial distributed can be **approximated using the normal distribution**, with continuity correction applied. For more information on CC, refer to the FAM-S section of the notes.

$$
    N \sim N(E(\ell_{t}), Var(\ell_{t}))
$$

!!! Note

    This further emphasizes that the number of survivors in the life table are the **expected** number of survivors; there is **no guarantee** that a given population will *exactly* follow the life table.

    Thus, questions involving $\ell_{x}$ can **ask for probabilities and variance**, which must be solved via this approach.

### **Non-Homogenous Cohort**

Some questions may provide **non-homogenous cohorts** where there are different groups of people with different mortality rates, but ask for the overall number of people.

Each group is modelled using their **own binomial distribution** based on their respective mortalities and are assumed to be independent of one another.

Usually, the sum of independent binomial variables with the *same probabilities* will be binomially distributed. However, note that since each group has **different survival probabilities**, the **combined distribution is NOT binomial**!

Thus, the normal approximation is usually used for these cases:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    N &= N_1 + N_2 \\
    \\
    E(N) &= E(N_1) + E(N_2) \\
    Var(N) &= Var(N_1) + Var (N_2) \\
    \\
    N &\sim N(E(N), Var(N))
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Fractional Age Assumptions**

One limitation of the life table is that it is computed at discrete ages while many problems require probabilities for non-discrete ages.

Thus, several **assumptions** about the life table that allows non-discrete values to be **interpolated** from the discrete ones, known as **Fractional Age Assumptions**.

### **Uniform Distribution of Deaths**

The **Uniform Distribution of Deaths** (UDD) is an assumption that allows for **Linear Interpolation** between discrete ages.

It assumes that there is a uniform distribution between integer ages, such that people are dying at a constant rate over the year; the **number of survivors decreases linearly** over the year.

!!! Note

    UDD is a valid assumption becomes the probability of dying in one month is not significantly different from another month.

    However, it becomes less appropriate at older ages as the probability death increases exponentially, even from month to month.

<!-- Self Made -->
![UDD](Assets/2.%20Life%20Tables.md/UDD.png){.center}

The number of survivors can thus be calculated via **linear interpolation**:

$$
    \ell_{x+s} = (1-s) \cdot \ell_{x} + s \cdot \ell_{x+1} \\
$$

!!! Warning

    The weights of the interpolation are seemingly **counter-intuitive** and are thus easily mixed up. Most people would take $s$ for $\ell_{x}$ because they are on the same side of the interpolation.

    However, a more intuitive way to think about it is that if the person is **closer to age $x$**, then they should have a **larger weight applied to that age**!

    This means that the **larger weight should be applied to the boundary age** that the estimated age is nearest to.

Firstly, we calculate the probability of surviving a **fractional amount of time from a discrete age**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{s}p_{x}
    &= \frac{\ell_{x+t}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{(1-s) \cdot \ell_{x} + s \cdot \ell_{x}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell_{x}-s\ell_{x} + s \ell_{x+1}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell_{x} - s(\ell_{x}-\ell_{x+1})}{\ell_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell_{x} - s d_{x}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell_{x}}{\ell_{x}} - s\frac{d_{x}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    &= 1 - s q_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{s}q_{x} &= s \cdot q_x
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    For most questions, it is sufficient to know the final result in terms of probabilities. However, if the question requires the fractional probability at a **fractional age**, it is much easier to use the first principles method based on the **number of lives**.

    Thus, make a conscious effort to remember both the probability and number of lives approximations.

Following the same logic, we calculate the probability of surviving a fractional amount of time **from a fractional age**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_{x+s}
    &= \frac{\ell_{x+s+t}}{\ell_{x+s}} \\
    &= \frac{[1-(s+t)] \cdot \ell_{x} + (s+t) \cdot \ell_{x+1}}{(1-s) \cdot \ell_{x} + s \cdot \ell_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Finally, the PDF and Force of Mortality can also be determined:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F_x(s) &= s \cdot q_x \\
    \\
    f_x(s)
    &= \frac{d}{ds} (s \cdot q_x) \\
    &= q_x \\
    \\
    \mu_{x+t}
    &= \frac{f_x(s)}{S_x(s)} \\
    &= \frac{q_x}{1-sq_x}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### **Impact on Expectation**

We can decompose the continuous lifetime into an **integer and a fractional component** $(R_x)$:

$$
    T_x = K_x + R_x
$$

Under UDD, we know that the fractional component is **uniformly distributed between 0 and 1**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    R_x &\sim \text{Uniform}(0, 1) \\
    E(R_x)
    &= \frac{0 + 1}{2} \\
    &= \frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, we can derive a formula for the continuous expectation:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(T_x) &= E(K_x) + E(R_x) \\
    \mathring{e}_{x} &= e_{x} + \frac{1}{2}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    In the previous section, we showed that the above relationship was approximately true using the trapezium rule. Under UDD, this relationship is **exact**.

    Thus, if a question requires the above formula, they should explicitly state that UDD holds.

Similarly, this impacts the discrete recursion formula. The intuition is that since the person could die uniformly throughout the year, **on average**, they would die in the middle of the year and thus would have had **half a year of future lifetime**: 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{1}}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        1, {}_{}p_{x} \\
        0.5, {}_{}q_{x}
    \end{cases} \\
    \\
    e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{1}}
    &= 1 \cdot {}_{}p_{x} + 0.5 \cdot {}_{}q_{x} \\
    &= {}_{}p_{x} + 0.5 \cdot {}_{}q_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore
    e_x
    &= e_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{1}} + {}_{}p_{x} \cdot e_{x+1} \\
    &= {}_{}p_{x} + 0.5 \cdot {}_{}q_{x} + {}_{}p_x \cdot e_{x+1} \\
    &= 0.5 \cdot {}_{}q_{x} + {}_{}p_{x} (1 + e_{x+1})
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Constant Force of Mortality**

The **Constant Force of Mortality** is an assumption that allows for **Exponential Interpolation** between discrete ages.

It assumes that there is a **constant force of mortality** *between integer ages*, such that the **number of survivors decreases exponentially** over the year.

<!-- Self Made -->
![Constant Force of Mortality](Assets/2.%20Life%20Tables.md/Constant%20Force.png){.center}

The number of survivors can thus be calculated via exponential interpolation:

$$
    \ell_{x+s} = \ell_{x}^{1-s} \cdot \ell_{x+1}^{s} \\
$$

!!! Warning

    Similar to before, the **larger weight should be applied to the boundary age** that the estimated age is nearest to.

Firstly, we calculate the probability of surviving a **fractional amount of time from a discrete age**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{s}p_{x}
    &= \frac{\ell_{x+s}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell_{x}^{1-s} \cdot \ell_{x+1}^{s}}{\ell_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell_{x+1}^t}{\ell_{x}^t} \\
    &= \left(\frac{\ell_{x+1}}{\ell_{x}} \right)^t \\
    &= ({}_{}p_{x})^t \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{s}q_{x} &= 1 - ({}_{}p_{x})^t
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    This result should not be surprising, as having a constant force means that survival within the year is **exponentialy distributed**.

    However, note that ONLY survival WITHIN the year is exponentially distributed - it is similar but NOT the same as assuming that the entire survival is exponentially distributed.

Following the same logic, we calculate the probability of surviving a fractional amount of time **from a fractional age**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p_{x+s}
    &= \frac{\ell_{x+s+t}}{\ell_{x+s}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell_{x}^{1-(s+t)} \cdot \ell_{x}^{s+t}}{\ell_{x}^{1-s} \cdot \ell_{x+1}^{s}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell_{x+1}^t}{\ell_{x}^t} \\
    &= \left(\frac{\ell_{x+1}}{\ell_{x}} \right)^t \\
    &= ({}_{}p_{x})^t
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    This further drives home the fact **age does not matter**, even at fractional ages, due to the memoryless property.

### **Given Probabilities**

If mortality follows the SULT, then the number of survivors can easily be obtained from there, allowing us to easily perform the above calculations.

However, some questions might provide their own mortality table. Some of these mortality tables will be provided in terms of number of survivors but sometimes they are provided in terms of probabilities.

In such cases, we can convert the **probabilities to the number of survivors** by choosing an **arbitrary number of survivors** for the first age provided and then multiplying the probabilities accordingly.

This way, we only need to remember the formulas using the number of survivors.

### **Other Assumptions**

The two assumptions are above are the typical fractional age assumptions. In practice, questions could use a variety of assumptions.

Instead of a *completely* constant force, some questions might provide a **linearly increasing** force between two different constant forces.

Essentially, this combines the key aspects of the above two methods:

$$
    \mu_{x+t} = \mu_1 \cdot (1-t) + \mu_2 \cdot t
$$

Thus, the survival probability during this period can be calculated via first principles:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S_X(t)
    &= e^{\int \mu_{x+t}} \\
    &= e^{\int \mu_1 \cdot (1-t) + \mu_2 \cdot t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Another assumption is that a certain **proportion of deaths** occur in a certain portion of the year.

For instance, "Between integer ages, two-thirds of deaths occur during the last six months of the year".

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{0.5}q_{x} &= \frac{1}{3} \cdot q_{x} \\
    {}_{0.5}q_{x+0.5} &= \frac{2}{3} \cdot q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Select & Ultimate Mortality**

Mortality rates for the general population versus individuals who buy life insurance tend to be different. Generally speaking, people who purchase insurance tend to be richer and thus have **better mortality rates than the general population**.

Within the individuals who purchase life insurance, those who have **recently purchased a policy tend to have better mortality**. This is because these individuals would have gone through
**Medical Underwriting** and thus is expected to be in better health.

!!! Tip

    "Better" mortality can be understood as having a higher chance to survive or lower chance to die.

The extent of the better mortality **decreases over time** and after a few years, they should experience the **same mortality** as the rest of the individuals who purchased life insurance. The duration of time is dependent on the *rigorousness of the underwriting process*.

Formally speaking, the individuals who purchased life insurance were *selected* by the underwriting process and thus the better mortality experienced is known as **Select Mortality**. Similarly, the time whereby the select mortality is better is known as the **Select Period**. The select mortality *ultimately* converges with the non-select group, known as the **Ultimate Mortality**.

!!! Warning

    The selection age is tied to when they went through underwriting, NOT when the policy is ultimately written.

### **Intepretation**

The subscript $[x]$ is used to denote the **age that the person was selected**. The years following that are represented by $[x]+1, [x]+2, \dots$.

Note the difference in intepretation:

* ${}_{n}p_{x}$ is the probability that a person aged $x$ survives $n$ years to age $x+n$.
* ${}_{n}p_{[x]}$ is the probability that a person aged $x$, that was **selected at age $x$**, survives $n$ years to age $x+n$.
* ${}_{n}p_{[x]+m}$ is the probability that a person aged $x+m$, that was **selected age $x$**, survives $n$ years to age $x+m+n$.

The **key properties** of select and ultimate mortality described previously can also be put into mathematical form. Let the select period be denoted by $d$.

Firstly, **before the select period finishes** $(t \lt d)$, select mortality is always better than ultimate mortality:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    q_{[x]+t} &\lt q_{x+t} \\
    p_{[x]+t} &\gt p_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Next, the effect of selection decreases over time; **more recently selected people** have better mortality:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{}q_{[x]} &\lt {}_{}q_{[x]+t} \\
    {}_{}p_{[x]} &\gt {}_{}p_{[x]+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Lastly, **once the select period finishes** $(t \gt d)$, it is the same as ultimate mortality:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    q_{[x]+t} &= q_{x+t} \\
    p_{[x]+t} &= p_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Select & Ultimate mortality is usually given in tabular form. Thus, the proper way to read the table would be **left to right during the select period** and then **downwards after the select period**:

![Select Table](Assets/2.%20Life%20Tables.md/Select%20Table.png){.center}

### **Alternative Intepretation**

Although the above method of denoting select and ultimate mortality is more common, an alternative intepretation is for $[x]$ to **denote the ultimate age instead**. The years *before* are represented by $[x], [x-1] + 1, [x-2] + 2, \dots$.

!!! Warning

    Given this possible alternative intepretation, always remember to check which notation the question specified.

Thus, the alternative way to read the table would be **diagonally to the bottom right** during the select period and then **downwards after the select period**:

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
