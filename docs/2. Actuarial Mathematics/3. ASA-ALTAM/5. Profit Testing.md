# **Profit Testing**

## **Overview**

For regular consumer goods, the cost of the product is known beforehand, thus its profitability can be determined beforehand. For insurance, the cost is **contingent on the mortality** of the policyholder, thus it is impossible to determine if the premium charged is adequate or not.



Recall that insurers make certain assumptions about the policyholder and thus price the product accordingly. If the policyholder follows these assumptions *exactly*, then the resulting profit is known as the **Expected Profit**. In reality, the policyholder will deviate from the assumptions to varying extents, resulting in the **Actual Profit**.

From an accounting perspective, what the insurer recognises as "profit" is the **excess** of actual profit over expected profit, also known as the **Gain** of the policy:

$$
    \text{Gain} = \text{Actual Profit} - \text{Expected Profit}
$$

## **Net Cashflow**

Consider the cashflows that occur in a **single period** from the **insurer's perspective**:

* **Period Start**: Collect **Premiums** (P) and incur **Maintenance Expenses** (e)
* **Period End**: Payout **Claims** (B) occurring in the period, along with any associated **Claim Expenses** (E)

It is typically assumed that the insurer will invest the net cashflows at the beginning of the period in order to **earn interest**. Thus, the net cashflow for the period is the combination of the above:

$$
    \text{Net Cashflow} = (P - e)(1+i) - q_{x} \cdot (B + E)
$$

!!! Note

    Even if the net cashflow in the beginning of the year is negative $(P - e < 0)$, the insurer will still invest the amount.

    In this case, it can be understood as the insurer has to **borrow money**, which they must then **pay interest** on at the end of the period.

!!! Tip

    The above expression can be enhanced to add in other benefits by applying the appropriate risk rates:

    * **Surrender Benefit**: Lapse Rate
    * **Maturity Benefit**: Survival Rate (last period only)
    * **Annuity Benefit**: Survival Rate

Notice that the expenses above were listed as maintenance expenses. This is because **Acquisition Expenses** are assumed to be **pre-contract expenses**. They are the **ONLY cashflow** in year 0 and will **NOT earn any interest**:

!!! Info

    In practice, acquisition expenses are usually grouped with the other cashflows that occur in the first policy year. However, the above is assumed for the purposes of this exam.

## **Emerging Profit**

For policyholders who **die** during the period, a **claim** must be paid out to them. However, the insurer does not need to fund the claim entirely from cashflows during the period; they have a **reserve** that was previously built up.

Conversely, for policyholders who **do not die** during the period, they must **set up a reserve** for them. This is because a **claim will be inevitably made** in some future period.

Thus, the reserve can be thought of like a **savings account** used to fulfil the **specific purpose** of meeting claims:

* **Period Start**: Insurer can access the reserve set up as at the previous period
* **Period End**: Insurer must set up a new reserve for the future claims that will be made

Similarly, the insurer is assumed to **invest the reserve** at the beginning of the period to maximize returns. The insurer has both the **interest earned** and **net cashflow** arising from that period available to set aside the new reserve. Any **remaining amount** can be **recognised as profit** as the insurer has **fulfilled their liabilities**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Profit}
    &= {}_{t-1}V \cdot (1+i) + \text{Net Cashflow} - p_{x} \cdot {}_{t}V \\
    &= \text{Net Cashflow} - \underbrace{p_{x} \cdot {}_{t}V - {}_{t-1}V \cdot (1+i)}_\text{Change in Reserves}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Some questions may provide the reserves will other questions may require us to compute it ourselves. Regardless, there are always two time points where the reserves are known:

    * **Policy Start**: Starting reserve is 0 (Reserve has not been set up yet)
    * **Policy End**: Ending reserve is 0 (No more future liabilities)

    <!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
    ![Special Reserves](Assets/5.%20Profit%20Testing.md/Special_Reserves.png){.center}

!!! Info

    Profit is often referred to as the profit that **emerges or arises** from that period, as it occurs at the **end of the period** as a combination of all other cashflows that occurred in that period.

## **Profit Basis**

Note that the projection basis (the assumptions used) for reserving and profit testing might be different:

* **Reserving Basis**: Conservative; Best-estimate with margin for adverse deviation
* **Profit Basis**: Realistic; best-estimate rates only

!!! Warning

    This includes ALL assumptions, not just risk rates. Interest rate could be different as well. Read the questions properly!

If the reserving and profit testing **basis are the same**, then there will be **NO profit** emerging from the policy. This is because the change in reserve (due to cashflows and unwinding) will **completely offset** the net cashflow emerging from the policy.

Thus, if actual experience exactly follows the best estimate assumptions, the insurer should earn a **profit from the margin for adverse deviation** that was held.

## **Profit Vector**

The **Profit Vector** of a policy is a vector containing the emerging profits from each policy year:

$$
\text{PR}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
    \text{PR}_{0} \\
    \text{PR}_ {1} \\
    \vdots \\
    \text{PR}_t
\end{pmatrix}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Profit Vector](Assets/5.%20Profit%20Testing.md/Profit%20Vector.png){.center}

!!! Warning

    The profit vector includes **policy year 0**, which is always just the pre-contract expenses.

For a typical life insurance contract, there is a typically a **negative profit** in the first year (new busines strain) due to the high cost of setting up the policy (expenses and reserves). Following that, **small magnitudes of positive profits** will emerge over its lifetime.

!!! Note

    Most questions will *only* require computing the profit vector for a short period of time given the intensity needed to calculate the reserves at various points in time.

    If required to compute the profit vector for a long duration, the question will usually specify to **ignore the change** in reserves or simply **provide them**, which greatly simplifies the required calculations.

## **Profit Signature**

Consider the expression for profit - an implicit assumption it makes is that the policyholder is **alive at the start of the period**. However, this means that each term in the profit vector is on a different basis and thus cannot be analyzed together.

To account for this, each element can be adjusted by accounting for the **probabilities of survival to the start of each period**. This converts each element into the **unconditional profit** that arises from the period, which can be analyzed together.

The resulting vector is known as the **Profit Signature** of the policy:

* **Profit Vector**: Profit at the **end** of period, assuming the policy is **in-force at the start of the period**
* **Profit Signature**: Profit at the **end** of period, assuming that the policy is **in-force at issue**

!!! Note

    This is why the terms in the profit signature are sometimes also referred to as the **Profit at Issue**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \boldsymbol{\pi}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \text{Unconditional Profit}_{0} \\
        \text{Unconditional Profit}_{1} \\
        \vdots
        \text{Unconditional Profit}_{t} \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        {}_{0}p_{x} \cdot \text{PR}_{0} \\
        {}_{1}p_{x} \cdot \text{PR}_{1} \\
        \vdots \\
        {}_{t-1}p_{x} \cdot \text{PR}_{t}
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Recall that ${}_{0}p_x = 1$, as it represents the probability of surviving till **this instant**!

## **Applications**

### **Profitability Metrics**

Using the profit cashflows above, insurers can gauge the **profitability** of the policy based on different metrics.

Firstly, the **Net Present Value** (NPV). It is the **EPV of the profits**, discounted using a specified **Risk Discount Rate**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{NPV}
    &= \sum^{t}_{0} v^{t} \cdot \text{Unconditional Profit}_{t} \\
    &= 1 \cdot \text{Unconditional Profit}_{0} + v^{1} \cdot \text{Unconditional Profit}_{1} + \dots 
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The Risk Discount Rate is also sometimes referred to as the **Hurdle Rate**. They represent the return that an investor expects to receive based on the risk profile of the business. It **can be different** from the interest rates used for reserving or profit testing.

Next, the **Internal Rate of Return** (IRR). It is the **Risk Discount Rate** that will cause the NPV to be 0:


$$
    \text{NPV}_\text{IRR} = 0
$$

!!! Warning

    IRR CANNOT be calcualted via an equation and must be solved using numerical methods or a financial calculator.

Next, is the **Discounted Payback Period** (DPP). It is the **earliest** period where the **partial NPV becomes positive**:

$$
    \text{DPP} = \min [t: \text{NPV}_{t} > 0]
$$

!!! Note

    The partial NPV is simply the NPV calculated as at a **different time point**, other than time 0. Unless otherwise stated, NPV usually refers to the NPV at issue, as described earlier.
    
    Thus, the DPP thus represents the time point where **all future profits are positive**.

Lastly, the **Profit Margin**. It is the ratio of the EPV of the profits (NPV) to that of the premiums:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Profit Margin}
    &= \frac{\text{NPV}}{\text{EPV(Premiums)}} \\
    &= \frac{\text{NPV (Unconditional Profit)}}{\text{NPV(Premiums)}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Both the NPVs must be calculated on the same basis - using the **same risk discount rate**.

### **Pricing**

An alternative method of pricing (compared to the equivalent principle) is to set premiums based on a **target profitability metric**. This is done by leaving the **premium component as a variable** within the profit calculation and solving for it given the desired profitability.

### **Reserving**

There are two considerations when analyzing profits:

* **Negative profits in later years** - company recognises positive profits early on, disregarding future losses, potentially leading to **solvency issues**
* **Negative Profits in early years** - companies want positive profits to emerge as early as possible (more profit on a discounted basis), thus they do **NOT want to hold more reserve than necessary** (which depresses profits)

The above two objectives can be achieved by setting the reserves via a process known as **Zeroization**. It sets reserving in a manner that **avoids negative profits in future years** and allows **positive profits to emerge as soon as possible**.

The reserves are calculated **recursively** starting from the **last policy year**:

* Set the profit emerging from that year to 0; **solve for the required opening reserve**
* If the starting reserve is negative, **floor it to 0** instead
* Repeat the process for all other policy years

!!! Tip

    Recall that the ending reserve is always 0. Thus, this method can always be used as long as the information to calculate the NCFs are provided.
    
    
    
      

* Recall that in the last policy year, the **ending reserve is 0**
* Set the **profit to 0** & solve for the starting reserve
* If the starting reserve is negative, **floor it at 0**
* Use the calculated amount above as the new ending reserve for the previous year & repeat the process until all reserves are calculated
* Since this process sets negative reserves to 0, it is known as **Zeroization**

Alternatively, the question may provide the **current profit** for each year, with the profit in some years being negative. The goal is then to calculate the reserves such that the negative profits are floored to 0.

The key is to understand that if the profit for all future years are positive, then the starting reserve for that year **will always be floored at 0**. Thus, using this, the reserves are recursively calculated:

* Start from the **latest policy year** with negative profits
* *Stop* once there are **no more negative profits**

There is *no need* to calculate the reserve for **earlier years** once all negative profits have been set to 0 because following the initial logic, the reserve for these earlier years **will be 0** given that all future profits are non-negative!

After Zeroization, **recalculate the profit** for all years:

* For years with negative profits where zeroization occurred, the **profit is 0**
* For years with positive profits but were **NOT just before** negative profit years, the **profit is unchanged**
* For years with positive profits but **were JUST before** negative profit years, the **profit is changed**

The profits have changed because there is now a new starting reserve for the following year with negative profits due to the zeroization. This affects the amount of reserve that has to be set up at the end of the current year, resulting in a new profit.

If this new profit turns out to be **negative as well**, then repeat the process once more.

### **Attribution**

## **Gains by Source**

As alluded to earlier, actual profits are simply profits that are **based on what actually happens** rather than what was assumed. From this and the expected profit, the gain from the policy is determined.

The difference in actual versus expected (AvE) assumptions typically comes in three aspects - Expenses, Interest & Mortality. Thus, the gain can also be *decomposed* into these three aspects to **precisely pinpoint** which assumptions need tweaking.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Total Gain}
    &= \text{Actual Profit} - \text{Expected Profit} \\
    &= \text{Expense Gain} + \text{Interest Gain} + \text{Mortality Gain}
\end{aligned}
$$

For this section, Expected and Actual variables are differentiated using "$'$".

### **Expense Gain**

Since expense is a cash *outflow*, gain is recognised when the **expected outflow is larger** than the actual outflow.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Expense Gain}
    &= \text{Assumed Expense Profit} - \text{Actual Expense Profit} \\
    &= e(1+i) - q_x \cdot E - (e'(1+i) - q_x \cdot E') \\
    &= (e-e')(1+i) - q_x (E-E')
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that since only the gain due to expenses are desired, **only the expense assumptions** go through the AvE process. The rest of the assumptions follow what was expected.

### **Interest Gain**

On the flipside, since interest is a cash *inflow*, gain is recognised when the **expected inflow is smaller** than the actual outflow.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Interest Gain}
    &= \text{Actual Interest Profit} - \text{Expected Interest Profit} \\
    &= ({}_{t-1}V + P - e') \cdot i' - ({}_{t-1}V + P - e') \cdot i \\
    &= (i' - i)({}_{t-1}V + P - e')
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, since only the gain due to interest is desired, **only the interest assumptions** go through the AvE process. However, since the expense gain was **already calculated**, the actual expense is directly used.

Thus, the **order of calculation** is important as it determines whether the actual or expected values are used - if the gain has already been calculated, then in all subsequent calculations, only the **actual assumptions** should be used.

> TBC the reason for this

### **Mortality Gain**

Similarly, mortality is a cash *outflow*, gain is recognised when the **expected outflow is larger** than the actual outflow.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Mortality Gain}
    &= \text{Assumed Mortality Profit} - \text{Actual Mortality Profit} \\
    &= q_x \cdot (B+E') + (1-q_x) \cdot {}_{t}V - [q'_x \cdot (B+E') + (1-q'_x) \cdot {}_{t}V] \\
    &= q_x \cdot (B+E') + {}_{t}V - q_x \cdot {}_{t}V - [q'_x \cdot (B+E') + {}_{t}V - q'_x \cdot {}_{t}V] \\
    &= q_x \cdot (B+E') + {}_{t}V - q_x \cdot {}_{t}V - q'_x \cdot (B+E') - {}_{t}V + q'_x \cdot {}_{t}V \\
    &= (q_x - q'_x)(B+E') - (q_x - q'_x){}_{t}V \\
    &= (q_x - q'_x)(B+E'-{}_{t}V)
\end{aligned}
$$

> The second term is also known as the **Net Amount at Risk**, which represents the *additional* amount that the insurer has to pay in the event of a claim.

In practice, the question may provide the actual **number of policyholders** (NOP) instead of the probabilities. Thus, we need to solve for the actual probabilities using:

$$
    q'_x = \frac{\text{NOP}_\text{Beginning} - \text{NOP}_\text{Ending}}{\text{NOP}_\text{Beginning}}
$$

For annuities, the expression is slightly different (TBC)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Mortality Gain}
    &= \text{Assumed Mortality Profit} - \text{Actual Mortality Profit} \\
    &= p_x \cdot (B+E') + p_x \cdot {}_{t}V - [p'_x \cdot (B+E') + p'_x \cdot {}_{t}V] \\
    &= p_x \cdot (B + E' + {}_{t}V) - p'_x (B + E' + {}_{t}V) \\
    &= (p_x - p'_x)(B + E' + {}_{t}V)
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Per Policy Gain**

All the above calculations are known as the **Per Policy** gains - if the actual number of policies are given, then each gain needs to be multiplied by the NOP to determine the total gain made by the insurer.
