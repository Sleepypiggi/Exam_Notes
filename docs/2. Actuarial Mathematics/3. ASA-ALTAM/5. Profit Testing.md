# **Profit Testing**

## **Overview**

For regular consumer goods, the cost of the product is known beforehand, thus its profitability can be determined beforehand. For insurance, the cost is **contingent on the mortality** of the policyholder, thus it is impossible to determine if the premium charged was adequate or not.

Thus, by making certain assumptions about the future experience of the policyholder, the insurer can project forward and determine the **expected profit** from the policy. The insurer can then **make adjustments** to assumptions or features to achieve their **desired profitability** - the process is known as **Profit Testing**.

## **Expected Profit**

### **Net Cashflow**

Consider the cashflows that occur in a **single period** from the **insurer's perspective**:

* **Period Start**: Collect **Premiums** (P) and incur **Maintenance Expenses** (e)
* **Period End**: Payout **Claims** (B) occurring in the period, along with any associated **Claim Expenses** (E)

It is typically assumed that the insurer will invest the net cashflows at the beginning of the period in order to **earn interest**. Thus, the net cashflow for the period is the combination of the above:

$$
    \text{Net Cashflow} = (P - e)(1+i) - q_{x} \cdot (B + E)
$$

!!! Note

    Even if the net cashflow in the beginning of the year is negative $(P - e < 0)$, the insurer will still invest the amount.

    In this case, it can be understood as the insurer has to **borrow money**, which they must then **pay interest** on at the end of the period.

!!! Tip

    The above expression can be enhanced to add in other benefits by applying the appropriate risk rates:

    * **Surrender Benefit**: Lapse Rate
    * **Maturity Benefit**: Survival Rate (last period only)
    * **Annuity Benefit**: Survival Rate

Notice that the expenses above were listed as maintenance expenses. This is because **Acquisition Expenses** are assumed to be **pre-contract expenses**. They are the **ONLY cashflow** in year 0 and will **NOT earn any interest**:

!!! Info

    In practice, acquisition expenses are usually grouped with the other cashflows that occur in the first policy year. However, the above is assumed for the purposes of this exam.

### **Emerging Profit**

For policyholders who **die** during the period, a **claim** must be paid out to them. However, the insurer does not need to fund the claim entirely from cashflows during the period; they have a **reserve** that was previously built up.

Conversely, for policyholders who **do not die** during the period, they must **set up a reserve** for them. This is because a **claim will be inevitably made** in some future period.

Thus, the reserve can be thought of like a **savings account** used to fulfil the **specific purpose** of meeting claims:

* **Period Start**: Insurer can access the reserve set up as at the previous period
* **Period End**: Insurer must set up a new reserve for the future claims that will be made

Similarly, the insurer is assumed to **invest the reserve** at the beginning of the period to maximize returns. The insurer has both the **interest earned** and **net cashflow** arising from that period available to set aside the new reserve. Any **remaining amount** can be **recognised as profit** as the insurer has **fulfilled their liabilities**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Profit}
    &= {}_{t-1}V \cdot (1+i) + \text{Net Cashflow} - p_{x} \cdot {}_{t}V \\
    &= \text{Net Cashflow} - \underbrace{p_{x} \cdot {}_{t}V - {}_{t-1}V \cdot (1+i)}_\text{Change in Reserves}
\end{aligned}
$$

The above expression is often referred to as the profit that **emerges or arises** from that period, as it occurs at the **end of the period** as a combination of all other cashflows that occurred in that period.

!!! Tip

    Some questions may provide the reserves will other questions may require us to compute it ourselves. Regardless, there are always two time points where the reserves are known:

    * **Policy Start**: Starting reserve is 0 (Reserve has not been set up yet)
    * **Policy End**: Ending reserve is 0 (No more future liabilities)

### **Profit Basis**

Note that the projection basis (the assumptions used) for reserving and profit testing might be different:

* **Reserving Basis**: Conservative; Best-estimate with margin for adverse deviation
* **Profit Basis**: Realistic; best-estimate rates only

!!! Warning

    This includes ALL assumptions, not just risk rates. Interest rate could be different as well. Read the questions properly!

If the reserving and profit testing **basis are the same**, then there will be **NO profit** emerging from the policy. This is because the change in reserve (due to cashflows and unwinding) will **completely offset** the net cashflow emerging from the policy.

Thus, if actual experience exactly follows the best estimate assumptions, the insurer should earn a **profit from the margin for adverse deviation** that was held.

### **Profit Vector**

The **Profit Vector** of a policy is a vector containing the emerging profits from each policy year:

$$
\text{PR}
=
\begin{pmatrix}
    \text{PR}_{0} \\
    \text{PR}_ {1} \\
    \vdots \\
    \text{PR}_t
\end{pmatrix}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Profit Vector](Assets/5.%20Profit%20Testing.md/Profit%20Vector.png){.center}

!!! Warning

    The profit vector includes **policy year 0**, which is always just the pre-contract expenses.

For a typical life insurance contract, there is a typically a **negative profit** in the first year (new busines strain) due to the high cost of setting up the policy (expenses and reserves). Following that, **small magnitudes of positive profits** will emerge over its lifetime.

!!! Note

    Most questions will *only* require computing the profit vector for a short period of time given the intensity needed to calculate the reserves at various points in time.

    If required to compute the profit vector for a long duration, the question will usually specify to **ignore the change** in reserves or simply **provide them**, which greatly simplifies the required calculations.

### **Profit Signature**

Consider the expression for profit - an implicit assumption it makes is that the policyholder is **alive at the start of the period**. However, this means that each term in the profit vector is on a different basis and thus cannot be analyzed together.

To account for this, each element can be adjusted by accounting for the **probabilities of survival to the start of each period**. This converts each element into the **unconditional profit** that arises from the period, which can be analyzed together.

The resulting vector is known as the **Profit Signature** of the policy:

* **Profit Vector**: Profit at the **end** of period, assuming the policy is **in-force at the start of the period**
* **Profit Signature**: Profit at the **end** of period, assuming that the policy is **in-force at issue**

!!! Note

    This is why the terms in the profit signature are sometimes also referred to as the **Profit at Issue**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \boldsymbol{\pi}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        \text{Unconditional Profit}_{0} \\
        \text{Unconditional Profit}_{1} \\
        \vdots
        \text{Unconditional Profit}_{t} \\
    \end{pmatrix}
    =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        {}_{0}p_{x} \cdot \text{PR}_{0} \\
        {}_{1}p_{x} \cdot \text{PR}_{1} \\
        \vdots \\
        {}_{t-1}p_{x} \cdot \text{PR}_{t}
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Recall that ${}_{0}p_x = 1$, as it represents the probability of surviving till **this instant**!

### **Multi State Models**

Multi State Models add another layer of complexity to profit projection which poses the following issues:

* **Multiple benefits** to consider
* Cashflows are **dependent on the state** that the policyholder is in
* Not possible to know **which state** the insured will be in at issue

The first issue on multiple benefits can be easily accounted for by considering the outgo from **ALL possible benefits** with their associated probabilities. The probability of survival must then be changed to the **probability of surviving ALL decrements**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{NCF}_{t} &= (P - e)(1+i) - \sum q^(ij)_{x} \cdot (B^{ij} + E^{ij}) \\
    \text{PR}_{t} &= \text{NCF}_{t} - [p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot {}_{t}V - {}_{t-1}V \cdot (1+i)]
\end{aligned}
$$

The remaining issues can be accounted for by considering **ALL possible states** that the policyholder could be in and their associated profit cashflows. The unconditional profit is the **probability weighted average** of the all possible states:

$$
    \text{Unconditional Profit}
    = p^{00} \cdot \text{PR}^{00} + p^{01} \cdot \text{PR}^{01} + p^{02} \cdot \text{PR}^{02} + \dots
$$



## **Profit Testing**

### **Profitability Metrics**

Using the profit cashflows above, insurers can gauge the **profitability** of the policy based on different metrics.

Firstly, the **Net Present Value** (NPV). It is the **EPV of the profits**, discounted using a specified **Risk Discount Rate**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{NPV}
    &= \sum^{t}_{0} v^{t} \cdot \text{Unconditional Profit}_{t} \\
    &= 1 \cdot \text{Unconditional Profit}_{0} + v^{1} \cdot \text{Unconditional Profit}_{1} + \dots 
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The Risk Discount Rate is also sometimes referred to as the **Hurdle Rate**. They represent the return that an investor expects to receive based on the risk profile of the business. It **can be different** from the interest rates used for reserving or profit testing.

Next, the **Internal Rate of Return** (IRR). It is the **Risk Discount Rate** that will cause the NPV to be 0:


$$
    \text{NPV}_\text{IRR} = 0
$$

!!! Warning

    IRR CANNOT be calcualted via an equation and must be solved using numerical methods or a financial calculator.

Next, is the **Discounted Payback Period** (DPP). It is the **earliest** period where the **partial NPV becomes positive**:

$$
    \text{DPP} = \min [t: \text{NPV}_{t} > 0]
$$

!!! Note

    The partial NPV is simply the NPV calculated as at a **different time point**, other than time 0. Unless otherwise stated, NPV usually refers to the NPV at issue, as described earlier.
    
    Thus, the DPP thus represents the time point where **all future profits are positive**.

Lastly, the **Profit Margin**. It is the ratio of the EPV of the profits (NPV) to that of the premiums:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Profit Margin}
    &= \frac{\text{NPV}}{\text{EPV(Premiums)}} \\
    &= \frac{\text{NPV (Unconditional Profit)}}{\text{NPV(Premiums)}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Both the NPVs must be calculated on the same basis - using the **same risk discount rate**.

### **Pricing**

An alternative method of pricing (compared to the equivalent principle) is to set premiums based on a **target profitability metric**. This is done by leaving the **premium component as a variable** within the profit calculation and solving for it given the desired profitability.

### **Reserving**

There are two considerations when analyzing profits:

* **Negative profits in later years** - company recognises positive profits early on, disregarding future losses, potentially leading to **solvency issues**
* **Negative Profits in early years** - companies want positive profits to emerge as early as possible (more profit on a discounted basis), thus they do **NOT want to hold more reserve than necessary** (which depresses profits)

The above two objectives can be achieved by setting the reserves via a process known as **Zeroization**. It sets reserving in a manner that **avoids negative profits in future years** and allows **positive profits to emerge as soon as possible**.

The reserves are calculated **recursively** starting from the **last policy year**:

* Set the profit emerging from that year to 0; **solve for the required opening reserve**
* If the starting reserve is negative, **floor it to 0** instead
* Repeat the process for all other policy years

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{PR}_{t} &= 0 \\
    \text{NCF}_{t} + p_{x} \cdot v_{t} - V_{t-1} \cdot (1+i) &= 0 \\
    V_{t-1} &= \frac{\text{NCF}_{t} + p_{x} \cdot v_{t}}{1+i} \\
    \\
    \therefore V^{z}_{t-1} &= \max (V_{t-1}, 0)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Recall that the **ending reserve is always 0**. Thus, this method can always be used as long as the information to calculate the NCFs are provided.

!!! Note

    The intuition behind zeroization might not be obvious, so consider the following thought process. The key is understanding that through zeroization, it ensures that every future policy year's reserve is **non-negative**; it will be **floored at 0**.

    If a starting reserve is solved to be negative, it means that the NCF arising from that year is **actually positive**; it needed an increase in reserve (negative to non-negative) to **offset the positive NCF** to force profit to 0. Thus, by setting the starting reserve to 0, it allows the **maximum possible NCF** to be realised as profit.

    An alternative perspective is that a negative reserve implies that all future inflows outweigh the inflows, thus the insurer **does not need to hold a reserve** to pay off future claims; hence it can be set at 0.

If the question already provides the existing profit cashflows, then the process can be streamlined - there is NO need to perform *all* the calculations top down. The key is to understand the main intuition that if the NCF from the year is positive, then the starting reserve can be **set at 0 without calculation**.

Similarly, start **recursively** from the last policy year:

* If the NCF is positive, set the opening reserve to 0
* If the NCF if negative, then perform the bottom up calculation to determine the reserve
* Repeat for all other policy years

## **Actual Profits**

If actual experience follows the assumptions exactly, the expected profit will materialize into **Actual Profits**. In reality, this is unlikely to occur, leading to deviation between the two. The difference is known as the **Gain** of the policy:

$$
    \text{Gain} = \text{Actual Profit} - \text{Expected Profit}
$$

Since gains occur as a result of assumption deviation, it can decomposed/attribution into the **gain from specific assumptions**, allowing the insurer to identify which assumptions may need to be reviewed. For the purposed of this exam, only **three assumptions** will be considered:

* Expense
* Interest
* Mortality

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Total Gain}
    &= \text{Actual Profit} - \text{Expected Profit} \\
    &= \text{Expense Gain} + \text{Interest Gain} + \text{Mortality Gain}
\end{aligned}
$$

For this section, let the actual experience be denoted with a **prime superscript** $'$.

### **Stepwise Attribution**

The method of attribution is known as **Stepwise Attribution**. It involves changing **one assumption at a time** (expected to actual), **on top of previous changes**, till the final set of assumptions are obtained (all actual).

The **difference between steps** is the gain from the assumption that was changed in the step:

<!-- Self Made -->
![Stepwise Attribution](Assets/5.%20Profit%20Testing.md/Stepwise_Attribution.png){.center}

The **order of attribution** is important. Although the total gain will remain the same, the amount allocated to each component will be different if a different order is used. This is due to the allocation of the **correlation impact**:

$$
    \text{Gain from Assumption} = \text{Absolute Gain} + \text{Correlation Impact}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Correlation Impact](Assets/5.%20Profit%20Testing.md/Correlation_Impact.png){.center}

Thus, different orders of attributions will result in **similar but ultimately different values**. Questions will usually  **specify the order** of attribution to use.

### **Expense Gain**

Since expense is a cash *outflow*, gains are recognised when the **expected outflow is larger** than the actual outflow:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Expense Gain}
    &= \text{Assumed Expense Profit} - \text{Actual Expense Profit} \\
    &= e(1+i) - q_{x} \cdot E - [e'(1+i) - q_x \cdot E'] \\
    &= (e-e')(1+i) - q_{x} (E-E')
\end{aligned}
$$

Additionally, since this is the **first attribution step**, ONLY the difference in expense needs to be accounted for. This is because the other assumptions are still assumed to be at their expected value, thus it will **offset** one another.

### **Interest Gain**

On the flipside, since interest is a cash *inflow*, gain is recognised when the **expected inflow is smaller** than the actual outflow:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Interest Gain}
    &= \text{Actual Interest Profit} - \text{Expected Interest Profit} \\
    &= ({}_{t-1}V + P - e') \cdot i' - ({}_{t-1}V + P - e') \cdot i \\
    &= (i' - i)({}_{t-1}V + P - e')
\end{aligned}
$$

Similarly, since this is **NOT the first** attribution step, all assumptions that have been attributed before must be included - **ALL instances** of the assumption should be using its **actual value**. This is to account for the **correlation impact** between the two.

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to use the expected expense assumption under the expected interest portion. Remember that ALL instances of the assumption should use their actual value.

### **Mortality Gain**

Similarly, mortality is a cash *outflow*, gain is recognised when the **expected outflow is larger** than the actual outflow.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Mortality Gain}
    &= \text{Assumed Mortality Profit} - \text{Actual Mortality Profit} \\
    &= q_{x} \cdot (B+E') + (1-q_{x}) \cdot {}_{t}V - [q'_{x} \cdot (B+E') + (1-q'_{x}) \cdot {}_{t}V] \\
    &= q_{x} \cdot (B+E') + {}_{t}V - q_{x} \cdot {}_{t}V - [q'_{x} \cdot (B+E') + {}_{t}V - q'_{x} \cdot {}_{t}V] \\
    &= q_{x} \cdot (B+E') + {}_{t}V - q_{x} \cdot {}_{t}V - q'_{x} \cdot (B+E') - {}_{t}V + q'_{x} \cdot {}_{t}V \\
    &= (q_{x} - q'_{x})(B+E') - (q_{x} - q'_{x}){}_{t}V \\
    &= (q_{x} - q'_{x})(B+E'-{}_{t}V)
\end{aligned}
$$

Questions may alternatively provide the actual **number of policyholders** (NOP) instead of the probabilities. Thus, we need to solve for the actual probabilities using:

$$
    q'_{x} = \frac{\text{NOP}_\text{Beginning} - \text{NOP}_\text{Ending}}{\text{NOP}_\text{Beginning}}
$$

### **Per Policy Gain**

All the above calculations are known as the **Per Policy** gains - if the actual number of policies are given, then each gain needs to be **multiplied by the NOP** to determine the total gain made by the insurer.
