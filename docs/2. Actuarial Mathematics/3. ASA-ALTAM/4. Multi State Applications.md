## **Disability Income Insurance**

Disability Income Insurance (DII) is a contract that pays out **routine benefits** to the insured **for as long** as they are **unable to work due to a disability** ("Unhealthy"). The primary purpose of DII is to **replace a portion of the income** of the insured while they are unable to work.

### **Product Features**

**Premiums** are usually non-guaranteed and level throughout the policy term, **payable regularly** as long as the insured is **healthy**.

**Benefits** are **payable regularly** while the insured is **unhealthy**, till the end of the benefit term or till the insured recovers (**whichever comes first**). There is typically a **waiting period** which is the minimum amount of time that must pass **since becoming disabled** before a benefit is paid out.

!!! Note

    The **Off Period** is the duration of time that must elapsed **between** claims for each claim to be treated as **seperate instances** of disability.

    This understanding is important as the benefit term is the **maximum** amount of time that benefits are payable for **each** disability. If the claims are treated as the same instance, they would count towards the same benefit term and potentially receive fewer benefit payments.

    The Off Period is counted from the **END** of the first disability period; when they stop receiving benefits (due to recovering or the benefit term ending).

The **magnitude of benefit** is dependent on the type of coverage purchased. The more likely the coverage is to be claimed, the lower the benefit:

* **Total Disability**: Unable to perform *any* job; unable to earn any income
* **Partial Disability**: Unable to perform *own* job; unable to earn original income
* Benefits for partial disability (own job) are smaller than total disability (any job)

!!! Note

    The magnitude is also affected by other minor factors such as **Inflation** or whether or not the insured is receiving **other forms of income**.

    Regardless, benefits are **intentionally only a fraction** of the original income (50-70%) to incentivize the insured to make a full recovery and return back to work.

### **Modelling**

DII is modelled using the **Sickness Death Model**:

* **State 0**: Healthy (No disability)
* **State 1**: Sick (Disability present)
* **State 2**: Dead

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![DII_Model](Assets/4.%20Multi%20State%20Applications.md/DII_Model.png){.center}

The key feature that differentiates DII from a regular annuity is the waiting period:

1. The **true term** of the policy is $n-w$; the policy would **expire before the waiting period is over** if they become disabled after that time
2. Insured becomes disabled at age $x+t$ but benefits only start at age $x+t+w$; functionally a **deferred annuity**
3. At age $x+t$, the insured is already disabled, thus a **sojourn annuity** is required

Thus, the actuarial value of the benefits can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV(Benefits)}
    &= \sum^{n-w}_{0} \text{P(Sick at time k)} \cdot \text{Deferred Sojourn Annuity at time k} \\
    &= \sum^{n-w}_{0} {}_{k}p^{00}_{x} \cdot p^{01}_{x+k} \cdot 
    \left(\ddot{a}^{\bar{11}}_{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{n-k}} - \ddot{a}^{\bar{11}}_{x+k:\enclose{actuarial}{w}} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    There are two possible durations for the sojourn annuity, depending on how long benefits are paid:

    * **Recover before policy term ends**: Benefit paid for **full duration** ($m+w$)
    * **Recover after policy term ends**: Benefit paid **till end of policy term** ($n-t$)

    The difference lies in the highlighted portion:

## **Long Term Care Insurance**

Long Term Care Insurance (LTCI) is a contract that pays out **routine benefits** to the insured **for as long** as they **cannot live independently** ("Unhealthy"), requiring long term care. LTCI is a form of **health insurance** whose primary purpose is to **cover the costs** of administering LTC, such as nursing homes.

Being unable to live independently is defined as being unable to independently perform one or more **Activities of Daily Living** (ADL):

1. Bathing
2. Dressing
3. Eating
4. Toileting (ability to use the toilet and manage personal hygiene)
5. Continence (ability to control bladder and bowel functions)
6. Transferring (getting in and out of a bed or chair)

### **Product Features**

**Premiums** are usually non-guaranteed and level throughout the policy term, **payable regularly** as long as the insured is **healthy**.

Benefits are also **payable regularly** while the insured is unhealthy, till the earliest of the benefit term or the death of the insured. However, they typically come in two forms:

* **Reimbursements**: Paid to **caregiving organization**; subject to a certain limit
* **Fixed Payments**: Paid to **policyholder**; flexibility to use the cash

!!! Note

    LTCI is also subject to a **waiting and off period** to avoid adverse selection.

### **Hybrid Features**

In practice, LTCI may be sold as a **Rider** to a main life insurance plan rather than being a standalone product. In these cases, there are some **additional features** that unique to the rider.

One common feature would be a **Return of Premiums** (ROP) benefit. If the amount of benefit paid out under the LTCI portion is **less than the total premiums paid**, the shortfall will be *returned* by being **added to the death benefit** of the policy.

Another feature would be **Benefit Acceleration**. LTCI benefits would be **paid out from the sum assured** of the policy, reducing it accordingly. The leftover amount would be paid out as the death benefit of the policy.

If there is an acceleration feature, then the policyholder could also opt in for an **Extension of Benefits** feature. It ensures that the benefit payments will continue for an **extended term** even after the sum assured has been depleted.

### **Modelling**

For the purposes of this exam, LTCI can be modelled using the following 5 state model:

* **State 0**: Able to perform **5 or more** ADLs independently (**Healthy**)
* **State 1**: Only able to perform **exactly 4** ADLs independently (**Disabled**)
* **State 2**: Only able to perform **3 or fewer** ADLs independently (**Severely Disabled**)
* **State 3**: Cognitive Impairment
* **State 4**: Dead

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![LTCI_Model](Assets/4.%20Multi%20State%20Applications.md/LTCI_Model.png){.center}

There are several points to take note of:

* The states are defined by the number of ADLs they *CAN* perform rather than cannot (Slightly counter-intuitive)
* The insured can recover from physical impairment but **cannot recover from cognitive impairment**

Given the **complexity** of the model, it is unlikely that a question would ask for the calculation of premiums or reserves directly. They would most likely require the use of the Kolmogorov or Thiele's **approximation methods**.

## **Continuing Care Retirement Communities**

One example of LTC is a **Continuing Care Retirement Community** (CCRC). They are residential facilities dedicated to providing care to seniors of *varying needs*:

1. **Independent Living Units** (ILU): Minimal assistance provided
2. **Assisted Living Units** (ALU): Only non-medical assistance provided (helping with ADL)
3. **Skilled Nursing Facility** (SNF): Medical assistance provided

### **Product Features**

There are three types of arrangements that people can opt for:

<center>

|              Type A              |               Type B               |             Type C             |
| :------------------------------: | :--------------------------------: | :----------------------------: |
|        **Full Life Care**        |       **Modified Life Care**       |        Fee For Service         |
|          High Entry Fee          |          Medium Entry Fee          |         Low Entry Fee          |
| **Level** payments for all units | Payments **step up** for new units | Pay **per use at market rate** |
|             Youngest             |             Middle Age             |             Oldest             |

</center>

!!! Note

    Type A and B contracts are considered insurance contracts as they **transfer the risk of increasing healthcare cost** to the CCRC provider.
    
    Similar to life insurance, the monthly payments are **higher than the actual cost of care** in the early ages (Pre-funding) and smaller than what the actual cost is later on.
    
    As such, type A and B customers must go through **medical underwriting** to prove that they are **healthy enough** to live independently at the time of entry. Since health tends to deteriorate with age, this is why type A and B individuals tend to be younger.

Some contracts also offer an **Entry Fee Refund** feature where a portion of the initial entry fee is paid to their beneficiaries when they leave the CCRC.

A variation of the above is that the entry fee is used to buy an **ownership stake** in the unit they are living in, which will be **sold to the next occupier** when they move out. The proceeds will then be **split between the individual and CCRC**, functionally returning part of the entry fee.

### **Modelling**

CCRC can be modelled using the following 5 state model:

* **State 0**: Independent Living Unit (**Healthy**)
* **State 1**: Assisted Living Unit (**Disabled**)
* **State 2**: Skilled Nursing Facility (**Severely Disabled**)
* **State 3**: *Temporary* Skilled Nursing Facility (**Medical Emergency**)
* **State 4**: Dead

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![CCRC_Model](Assets/4.%20Multi%20State%20Applications.md/CCRC_Model.png){.center}

One key difference from the LTCI model is that this model **does NOT allow for recoveries**. This greatly simplifies the model, which opens up the type of questions that can be asked.

!!! Info

    Intuitively, the reason is because CCRC is **open to Seniors only**, whose health will undoubtedly deteriorate with time.

## **Critical Illness Insurance**

Critical Illness Insurance (CII) is a contract that pays out a **lump sum** benefit to the insured upon being diagnosed with a **critical illness**. Similar to life insurance, the primary purpose of CII is to **replace the income** of the insured as they are unable to work while they are recovering from CI.

The **definition** of CI varies from insurer to insurer, but most insurers cover a basic set of illnesses such as Heart Attack, Stroke, Major Organ Failure and most common forms of Cancer.

### **Product Features**

**Premiums** are usually guaranteed and level throughout the policy term, **payable regularly** as long as the insured is **healthy**.

A **lump sum benefit** is payable when the insured becomes diagosed with a CI. The **benefit ceases** once the benefit has been paid - but the policy **does not necessarily lapse** as a death benefit may be payable as well.

Unlike LTCI, CII main plans themselve could offer a partial **Return of Premium** feature if the policy expires or lapses with no benefits paid.

!!! Warning

    Although using the name, the ROP feature for CII and LTCI function very differently. CII ROP can only be used if **NO claim** was made at all.

### **Hybrid Features**

Similarly, CII could be instead offered as a rider to a life insurance policy. In this case, the CI benefit will **accelerate the death benefit** and thus reduce the sum assured accordingly:

* **Balance left**: CI benefit only **partially accelerated** the DB; remaining amount **payable on death**
* **No balance left**: CI benefit **fully accelerated** the DB; **nothing payable left** thus policy lapses

### **Modelling**

CII can be modelled using the following 3 state model:

1. **State 0**: Healthy
2. **State 1**: Critically Ill
3. **State 2**: Dead

## **Structured Settlements**

Structured Settlements are an arrangement in a **liability case**, where the **Responsible Party** (RP) must compensate the **Injured Party** (IP). The compensation typically includes a **Lump Sum** portion to cover immediate losses and an **annuity** portion to cover the potential **loss of income or rehabilitation costs** as a result of the accident.

!!! Note

    The compensation schedule is usually determined by the RP’s **Liability Insurance** policy. The RP could either be another person (EG. Motor Insurance) or could be a corporation (EG. Worker’s Compensation).

### **Product Features**

Similar to before, the annuity benefits are typically **smaller than the original income** of the IP to incentivize them to return to work.

If the damage is **severe**, the long-term care needed will only be known after the IP goes through an initial period of treatment, till they reach the point of **Maximum Medical Improvement** (MMI). Before MMI, the RP will pay an interim benefit till the settlment is finalized.

### **Modelling**

For the purposes of this exam, only structured settlements involving **Workers Compensation** will be covered. The key difference is that they are **reviewable**. This means that the annuity benefits can be **conditional** and stop once the individual is recovered (rather than being for life under a non-reviewable settlement).

Reviewable Workers Compensation settlements can be modelled using the following 4 state model:

* **State 0**: Uncertain Diagnosis
* **State 1**: Recovered
* **State 2**: Permanently Disabled
* **State 3**: Dead
