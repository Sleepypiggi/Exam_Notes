# **Embedded Options**

## **Overview**

Due to developments in the financial market, insurance products had to evolve to remain relevant. This led to development of **Unit Linked Insurance**, where policy benefits were **linked** to the performance of an **underlying mutual fund**.

In order to attract investors, these products usually come **guarantees** on their benefits, providing **unlimited upside and limited downsides**. However, this results in insurance companies bearing **huge financial risks**.

Traditional actuarial methods were not well suited to effectively deal with these risks, which led to the insolvency of many insurance companies in the 1990s when interest rates fell. This led to the creation of **Market Consistent** valuation basis to ensure that these risks are appropriately accounted for.

As its name suggests, market consistent valuation involves valuing an asset at its **observed market value**. However, insurance contracts are almost never traded, thus does not have an observable market value. Instead, the insurance cashflows are **translated into tradeable assets**, where the value of the contract is **equivalent to the price** of the assets.

The guarantees offered unit linked insurance can be translated into an **Option**, which is why it can be valued as an **Embedded Option**.

## **Unit Linked Insurance**

The defining feature of Unit Linked insurance is that the policyholder's premiums are **invested into units** of one or more mutual funds of the policyholder's choice. The **policy benefits are directly linked** to the total value of the units in the policyholder's account.

    It is a common mistake to confuse universal life and unit linked policies as both involve an account for the policyholder.

    However, it is imperative to remember that the **universal life account is purely notional** while there **exists an actual account** for each policyholder under a unit linked policy.
