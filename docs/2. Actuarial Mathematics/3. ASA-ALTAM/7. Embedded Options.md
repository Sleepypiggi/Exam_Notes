# **Embedded Options**

## **Overview**

Due to developments in the financial market, insurance products had to evolve to remain relevant. This led to development of **Equity Linked Insurance**, where policy benefits were **linked** to the performance of an **underlying mutual fund**.

In order to attract investors, these products usually comes with **guarantees** on their benefits, providing **unlimited upside and limited downsides**. However, this results in insurance companies bearing **huge financial risks**.

!!! Info

    These guarantees may not be part of the product features, but offered as a rider for additional cost.

Traditional actuarial methods were not well suited to effectively deal with these risks, which led to the insolvency of many insurance companies in the 1990s when interest rates fell. This led to the creation of **Market Consistent** valuation basis to ensure that these risks are appropriately accounted for.

As its name suggests, market consistent valuation involves valuing an asset at its **observed market value**. However, insurance contracts are almost never traded, thus does not have an observable market value. Instead, the insurance cashflows are **translated into tradeable assets**, where the value of the contract is **equivalent to the price** of the assets.

The guarantees offered Equity Linked insurance can be translated into an **Option**, which is why it can be valued as an **Embedded Option**.

## **Equity Linked Insurance**

The defining feature of Equity Linked insurance is that the policyholder's premiums are **invested into units** of one or more mutual funds of the policyholder's choice. The **policy benefits are directly linked** to the total value of the units in the policyholder's account.

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to confuse universal life (UL) and Equity Linked (EL) policies as both involve an **account** for the policyholder:

    * **Universal Life**: Account is purely notional; known as **Account Value**
    * **Equity Linked**: Account is actually invested in funds of choice; known as **Fund Value**

### **Unit VS Non-Unit Account**

The key to understanding Equity Linked insurance is to understand the difference between:

* **Unit Account**: Owned by Policyholders; where premiums are invested
* **Non-Unit Account**: Owned by Company (Shareholders); where benefits and expenses are paid out from

Every period, **charges** are posted to the unit account to cover the cost of the policy (Mortality & Expense charges, similar to UL). These charges then flow into the non-unit account as **fee income**, which is then used to **cover the actual cost** of the policy.

<!-- Self Made -->
![Unit_Linked](Assets/7.%20Embedded%20Options.md/Unit_Linked.png){.center}

!!! Tip

    There are two distinct cashflows:

    * **Charges**: Posted to Unit Account, flows into Non Unit Account as Income
    * **Cost**: Posted to Non Unit Account, actual cost of the policy

    The amount charged to the policyholder and the actual are often different - where the charges are higher than the cost, allowing the insurer to **earn the spread**. For instance, the fund management charge might be $100 - but the insurer only incurs $70 of investment expenses (due to economies of scale), allowing them to earn the difference.

!!! Warning

    Only **NON-unit** account cashflows should be used for **profit testing**. The confusion arises because unit account cashflows must be projected as well to obtain the charges.

    The following cashflows are easily mixed up:

    * Expense Fee Income vs Actual Expenses
    * Fund Growth vs Investment Income
    * Benefit Charge vs Benefit Cost

    Another common confusion comes from calculating **Profit Margin**. Even though only the unallocated premiums flow into the profit calculation, the profit margin is calculated **based on the Total Premium**.

Another intuitive way to think about it is that for **all other types of policies**, there exists only a **non-unit account**. The premiums paid might be more/less than the cost of the policy, the excess/shortfall is managed by the **insurer's investments**.

The key difference is that the premiums are **invested by the policyholder**; only what is needed is deducted each period. The **investment risk is borne by the policyholder** instead.

### **Premium Allocation**

Only the **Allocated Premium** is used to **purchase units**; the remaining un allocated premium flows directly into the unit account. The **proportion** of premium that is allocated is controlled by the **Allocation Rate**:

$$
    \text{Allocated Premium} = \text{Premium} \cdot \text{Allocation Rate}
$$

!!! Note

    It is possible for the allocation rate to be *above* 100%. The insurer will fund the additional amount as an outflow.

When purchasing units, part of the value will be lost due to **Transactional Costs** such as the **Bid Offer Spread**:

* **Bid Price**: How much the fund manager is bidding for the unit (Sell price)
* **Offer Price**: How much the fund manager is asking for the unit (Buy price)

The units are purchased based on the Offer Price but values at the Bid Price. However, Offer prices are **always higher** than bid prices, this leads to an immediate **loss in value** compared to the premium paid:

$$
    \text{Unit Value Purchased} = \text{Allocated Premium} \cdot (1 - \text{Bid Offer Spread})
$$

!!! Note

    Some questions might not use the term BO spread but rather a **Premium Charge**. In either case, the key concept from this section is to understand that not the entire premium is invested in the fund.

### **Fund Value**

For the purposes of this exam, the fund value in each period can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{FV}
    &= (\text{Allocated Premium} - \text{Fund Expenses}) \\
    & \cdot (1 + \text{Fund Growth}) \cdot (1 - \text{Fund Charge})
\end{aligned}
$$

For the purposes of this exam, the **methods** and **timing** of the above cashflows will be **specified by the question**. They are all usually calculated as **percentage of the fund value** at different points (EG. Management Charges uses FV after interest etc).

<!-- Self Made -->
![Unit Fund](Assets/7.%20Embedded%20Options.md/Unit_Fund.png){.center}

!!! Warning

    The above breakdown is based on what is commonly done in practice. It is possible for a question to have fewer cashflows or have them projected at different timings (EG. No mortality charge & Management Charge at BOP). 

### **Policy Benefits**

As mentioned previously, the benefits of the policy are **tied** to the value of the unit account:

$$
    \text{Death Benefit} = \text{Surrender Benefit} = \text{Account Value}
$$

However, due to the **volatile nature** of investing, some policyholders could end up with **low fund values** and hence low coverage. Thus, most policies offer a **guaranteed minimum benefit** that will kick in **if the account value is below a certain threshold**.

The most common variation is to offer a **guaranteed minimum benefit** based on some multiple $\lambda$ of the **premiums paid to date**:

$$
     \text{Minimum Benefit} = \text{Lambda} \cdot \text{Premium Paid to Date}
$$

The Guaranteed Benefit (GB) will be paid **if the Account Value (AV) is smaller** than the guarantee. Thus, the benefit of the policy can be expressed as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Policy Benefit}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        \text{AV}, & \text{AV} > \text{GB} \\
        \text{GB}, & \text{AV} <= \text{GB}
    \end{cases} \\
    &= \max (\text{AV}, \text{GB})
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, similar to UL policies, the insurer does not pay the full benefit amount - they pay the **shortfall** of the account value compared to the guarantee.

Conceptually, this is analogous to the COI - which is why it is known as the **Cost of Guarantees** (COG).

$$
    \text{COG} = \max(\text{GB} - \text{FV}) \cdot q_{x}
$$

## **Embedded Options**

With some manipulation, the above expression for policy benefit can be expressed in the form a **European Put Option Payoff**:

* Guaranteed Benefit is a **fixed value**, similar to the **Strike Price**
* Account Value follows a **stock price process** (with charges applied)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Put Option Payoff}_{t}
    &= \max (K - S_{t}, 0) \\
    \\
    \text{Policy Benefit}_{t}
    &= \max (\text{AV}_{t}, \text{GB}) \\
    &= \max (\text{GB} - \text{AV}_{t}, \text{AV}_{t} - \text{AV}_{t}) \\
    &= \max (\text{GB} - \text{AV}_{t}, 0)
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the same framework used to evaluate european put options - **Black Scholes Merton** model - can be used to evaluate these guaranteed benefits as well. However, there is one **key difference** between the two that must be accounted for:

* **Regular Option**: Time to expiration (when the option is exercised) is **fixed**
* **Embedded Option**: Time is **contingent** on the survival/death of the policyholder

Thus, the framework must be adjusted slightly to account for the **probabilities of death/survival** within the given timeframe.

!!! Note

    Please refer to the **Derivatives Section** of the IFM notes for more information on European Options and the Black Scholes model.

Unless otherwise stated, all policies referenced in this section are assumed to be **Single Premium** policies with **no additional top ups**.

### **Guaranteed Maturity Benefit**

The maturity benefit is paid at a **known time** (at the **end of the policy term**), given that the policyholder is **alive at that time**.

For simplicity, assume that the policy has a **Guaranteed Minimum Maturity Benefit** (GMMB) of some **multiple of premiums paid**:

$$
    \text{GMMB} = \lambda P
$$

!!! Note

    The expression is simplified in this case since we assume a single premium policy.

The account value projection earlier assumes that the fund grows at a **specified rate**. An alternative method is to assume that it grows at the same rate as an **underlying stock process**. Thus, the account value **at maturity** of time $n$ can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{AV}_{n}
    &= \text{Opening Value} \cdot \text{Charges} \cdot \text{Growth} \\
    &= P \cdot (1 - \text{IC}) \cdot (1 - \text{RC})^{n-1} \cdot \frac{S_{n}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P \cdot \xi \cdot \frac{S_{n}}{S_{0}} \\
    \\
    \xi &= (1 - \text{IC}) \cdot (1 - \text{RC})^{n-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The charges in this scenario have have been simplified to **Initial Charges** (IC) and **Renewal Charges** (RC). Both are charged as a **percentage of the account value** at the time.

    They are then further **combined** into $\xi$, since they have a **fixed value** (dependent only on policy term, which is fixed for each policy).

!!! Warning

    Some questions might provide the monthly rates instead of annual rates - do not blindly apply the formulas.

The payoff of the option *on maturity* is denoted as $h(n)$ and can be expressed as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    h(n)
    &= \max (\text{GB} - \text{AV}_{t}, 0) \\
    &= \max  \left(\lambda P - P \cdot \xi \cdot \frac{S_{n}}{S_{0}}, 0 \right) \\
    &= P \xi \cdot \max \left(\frac{\lambda}{\xi} - \frac{S_{n}}{S_{0}}, 0 \right) \\
    &= P \xi \cdot \max \left(\frac{\lambda}{\xi} - S_{n}, 0 \right) \\
    &= P \xi \cdot \max \left(K^{*} - S_{n}, 0 \right) \\    
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    The above can be intepreted as requiring $P \xi$ european put options with strike price $\frac{\lambda}{\xi}$.

Under the Black Scholes Merton framework, the value of **ONE** of the above european put options **on inception** is the **risk neutral expected present value** of the payoff:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    p(0)
    &= e^{-rn} \cdot E^{Q}_{t} \left[\max (K^{*} - S_{n}, 0) \right] \\
    &= e^{-rn} \cdot \left(K^{*} \cdot \Phi [- d_{2}(0)] - S_{n} \cdot \Phi [-d_{1}(0)] \right) \\
    &= K^{*} e^{-rn} \Phi [- d_{2}(0)] - S_{0} \cdot \Phi [-d_{1}(0)] \\
    \\
    d_{1}(0)
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{0}}{K} + (r + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) n}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} \\
    &= d_{2}(0) + \sigma \sqrt{n} \\
    \\
    d_{2}(0)
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{0}}{K} + (r - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) n}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} \\
    &= d_{1}(0) - \sigma \sqrt{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    $\Phi(x)$ represents the CDF of the standard normal distribution at $x$. It can be determined via the NORM.S.DIST **Excel Function**.

!!! Note

    In practice, investors take **into account risk** when looking for looking for returns (which affects asset prices). For instance, if the risk-free rate is $r$, then investors demand a **risk premium** for that them to take on an **investment with risk**.

    Under a risk neutral basis, it assumes that investors do NOT take into account risk. Thus, assets will be **priced based on the risk free rate**, rather than on the actual return (with a risk premium).

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        S_{n} &= S_{0} \cdot e^{\alpha n} = S_{0} \cdot e^{rn} \\
        \therefore e^{-rn} \cdot S_{n} &= S_{0}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

The *value* of the **entire embedded option** is the **expected number** of european put options needed on maturity. Thus, the probability of maturing must be accounted for:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \pi(0)
    &= {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot P \xi \cdot p(0) \\
    &= {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot P \xi \cdot \left(K^{*} e^{-rn} \Phi [- d_{2}(0)] - S_{0} \cdot \Phi [-d_{1}(0)] \right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Since $T_{x}$ and $S_{x}$ are **independent** processes, the risk neutral expectation ("Q") of future lifetime is equivalent to the true ("P") probabilities.

    $$
        E^{Q}(T_{x} \gt n) = E^{P}(T_{x} \gt n) = {}_{10}p_{x}
    $$

The above can be adjusted to reflect **valuation at any time** $t$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \pi(t)
    &= {}_{n-t}p_{x+t} \cdot P \xi \cdot p(t) \\
    &= {}_{n-t}p_{x+t} \cdot P \xi \cdot \left(K^{*} e^{-r(n-t)} \Phi [-d_{2}(t)] - S_{t} \cdot \Phi [-d_{1}(t)] \right) \\
    \\
    d_{1}(t)
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{t}}{K^{*}} + (r + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) (n-t)}{\sigma \sqrt{n-t}} \\
    &= d_{2}(t) + \sigma \sqrt{n-t} \\
    \\
    d_{2}(t)
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{t}}{K^{*}} + (r - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) (n-t)}{\sigma \sqrt{n-t}} \\
    &= d_{1}(t) - \sigma \sqrt{n-t}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    The above is obtained going through the **same process**, just that the **valuation date** is time $t$ instead of time $0$, which affects the following:

    * **Time to Maturity**: Changed from $n$ to $n-t$
    * **Initial Stock Price**: Changed from $S_{0}$ to $S_{t}$
    * **CDF**: Updated to reflect the above changes as well
  
    Note that $\xi$ **does NOT** depend on the time to maturity, thus does not need to be changed.

### **Guaranteed Death Benefit**

Unlike the Maturity Benefit which is paid out at a fixed time (end of the policy term), the death benefit is paid out at an **unknown time** ($T$), depending on when the policyholder dies. Thus, the insurer needs **an option for every possible time** that the policyholder could die.

The expression is the same as before, just that the **constant $n$ is replaced with the variable $T$** to reflect the unknown time of payout:

* Valuation Time, $t$
* Payout Time, $T$

The value of the guarantee for **each possible period** $n$ can be expressed as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(0, T) &= K^{*} \cdot e^{-rT} \Phi [-d_{2}(0, T)] - S_{0} \cdot \Phi [-d_{1}(0, T)] \\
    \\
    d_{1}(0, T)
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{0}}{K^{*}} + (r + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}} \\
    &= d_{2}(0, T) + \sigma \sqrt{T} \\
    \\
    d_{2}(0, T)
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{0}}{K^{*}} + (r - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) T}{\sigma \sqrt{T}} \\
    &= d_{1}(0, T) - \sigma \sqrt{T}
\end{aligned}
$$

The value of the entire embedded option must reflect the expected number of options needed to hedge the risk in **EACH period for ALL periods**:

$$
    \pi(0) = \sum^{n}_{1} P(0, T) \cdot {}_{T-1}p_{x} \cdot q_{x+T-1}
$$

!!! Note

    Similar to before, the above expression can be adjusted to determine the value of the guarantee at a **specified period** for reserving purposes. It can also be adjusted for benefits that are paid monthly as well.

### **Funding**

The cost of the guarantee is passed down to the policyholder in one of two ways:

* **Front-End Load**: Deducted **once** on inception
* **Risk Premium** ($\text{RP}$): Deducted **routinely** as part of the **management charges** ($\text{MC}$)

The front end approach is intuitive - the value of the guarantee $\pi(0)$ is deducted from the single premium alongside the initial charges on inception.

The risk premium approach requires us to determine the **proportion of the fund value** to be charged each period:

* **Total Management Charge Rate** ($m$), *including* the risk premium for the guarantee
* **Management Charge Rate** ($m^*$), *exclusing* the risk premium
* **Risk Premium Rate** ($c$)

$$
    m = m^* + c
$$

Consider a **general expression for the fund value** in each period:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{AV}_{0} &= P \\
    \\
    \text{RP}_{1} &= cP \\
    \text{MC}_{1} &= m^{*}P \\
    \therefore F_{1}
    &= (\text{AV}_{0} - \text{RP}_{1} - \text{MC}_{1}) \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= [P - cP- m^{*}P] \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P(1 - c - m^{*}) \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P(1 - (c+m^{*})) \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P(1-m) \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}} \\
    \\
    \text{RP}_{2} &= cP(1-m) \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}}\\
    \text{MC}_{1} &= m^{*}P(1-m) \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}}\\
    \therefore \text{AV}_{2}
    &= (F_{1} - \text{RP}_{2} - \text{MC}_{2}) \cdot \frac{S_{2}}{S_{1}} \\
    &= [P(1-m) - cP(1-m) - m^{*}P(1-m)] \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}} \cdot \frac{S_{2}}{S_{1}} \\
    &= P(1-m) [1 - c - m^{*}] \cdot \frac{S_{2}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P(1-m)[1- (c+m^{*})] \cdot \frac{S_{2}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P(1-m)(1-m) \cdot \frac{S_{2}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P(1-m)^{2} \cdot \frac{S_{2}}{S_{0}} \\
    \\
    \therefore \text{AV}_{t}
    &= P(1-m)^{t} \cdot \frac{S_{t}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P(1-m)^{t} \cdot S_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The above might seem redundant as it ultimately decomposes into the same Charges and Growth expressed previously. The point WAS to show that even under the current setup, the process does not change.

!!! Warning

    Under the above expression, the growth factor $\frac{S_{t}}{S_{0}}$ is using the cumulative **growth from inception**, as the **starting fund value** $P$ is used.

!!! Tip

    Since the **growth rate** is considered, we set $S_{0}$ to **1 for simplicity**. This assumption should be used for the remainder of the section.

Thus, we can obtain the risk premium charged in each period. However, since the amount to charge needs to be determined at inception, we need to consider its EPV:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{RP}_{t} &= c \cdot P(1-m)^{t} \cdot S_{t} \\
    \text{PV(RP)}_{t} &= c \cdot P(1-m)^{t} \\
    \text{EPV(RP)}
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{0} c \cdot P(1-m)^{t} {}_{t}p_{x} \\
    &= cP \sum^{n-1}_{0} (1-m)^{t} {}_{t}p_{x} \\
    &= cP \sum^{n-1}_{0} (v^{*})^{t} {}_{t}p_{x} \\
    &= cP \cdot \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n} i^{*}} \\
    \\
    v^{*} &= (1-m) \\
    \frac{1}{1+i^{*}} &= (1-m) \\
    1+i^{*} &= \frac{1}{1-m} \\
    i^{*} &= 1 - \frac{1}{1-m} \\
    i^{*} &= \frac{1-m-1}{1-m} \\
    i^{*} &= \frac{m}{1-m}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Under a **risk neutral assumption**, the present value of the stock price is the value at inception, which we have assumed to be 1.

    Additionally, note that limits of the summation **start from 0** and end at $n-1$, as the first risk premium charge does not include any prior management charges (they are **charged at the same time**).

The EPV of the risk premium and the cost of the guarantee should be the **same**, allowing us to solve for the risk premium rate:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \pi(0) &= cP \cdot \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n} i^{*}} \\
    c &= \frac{\pi(0)}{P \cdot \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n} i^{*}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    If the question specifies a risk premium rate and asks to calculate for the cost of the guarantee, it **might NOT equate** to the cost of the guarantee if it were calculated in a bottom's up manner.

### **Hedging**

Given that the guaranteed benefits follow the payoff of a european put option, the insurer can **perfectly hedge the risk** by either:

1. **Purchasing a European Put Option** with the specified parameters from a third party
2. **Creating a replicating portfolio** of Stocks and Bonds

!!! Note

    Hedging GMMBs only require **one** put option while a GMDB requires **multiple** options, one expiring at each year.

!!! Note

    Traditional life insurance policies bring **mortality risk** to the insurer. This can be diversified by selling more policies, as **each policyholder has a different mortality**. Given a sufficiently large pool, the mortality of the entire pool becomes stable (Law of Large Numbers).

    However, equity linked insurance brings **investment risk** to the insurer. Every policyholder experiences the **same investment risk** from the market, thus it **cannot be diversified via selling more policies**. This is why there is a need for specific hedging procedures.

#### **External Hedging**

The first method involves **purchasing** the required options from an **external third party**. The cost of the option(s) are incurred as a **pre-contract expense**.

With the option, the risk of the guarantee is effectively ceded to the option seller. Thus, the insurer should **not incur any cost of guarantees**.

The main issue with this approach is the **availability** of the option(s) with the specified parameters (Strike Price & Duration).

#### **Internal Hedging**

Alternatively, the insurer can create a **replicating portfolio** of stocks and zero-coupon bonds that will match the payoff of the required option(s). If the guarantee would be exercised, the insurer will **liquidate** the replicating portfolio to cover the cost.

Each Put Option can be decomposed into a Stock and Zero-Coupon Bond:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    p(0)
    &= K^{*} e^{-rn} \Phi [- d_{2}(0)] - S_{0} \cdot \Phi [-d_{1}(0)]
    &= \text{Bond Value} + S_{0} \cdot \text{Number of Stocks} \\
    \\
    \text{Bond Value} &= K^{*} e^{-rn} \Phi [- d_{2}(0)] \\
    \text{Number of Stocks} &= - \Phi [-d_{1}(0)]
\end{aligned}
$$

It can be intepreted as:

* Positive (Negative) Stock Value: **Buy/Sell** that amount of stocks
* Positive (Negative) Bond Value: **Borrow/Lend** that amount of money

!!! Note

    The derivation can be found in the **Option Greeks** section of exam IFM. For the purposes of this exam, it is sufficient to **memorize the formulas** instead.

The replicating portfolio is incurred at the start of the policy as is treated as a **pre-contract expense**. The replicating portfolio **functionally acts as a reserve** for the cost of the policy. Each period, part of the replicating portfolio will be **liquidated** (“released”) to cover the expected guarantee costs for that period.

The release occurs due to the portfolio needing to **re-balanced** every period:

* The portfolios value changes every period due to **market movement**
* It may become **larger/smaller than what is required** for future periods
* Thus, **excesses are released** while shortfalls are incurred as additional rebalancing costs

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Heding Release}_{t}
    &= \text{Before Rebalancing}_{t} - \text{Portfolio Required}_{t} \\
    \\
    \text{Before Rebalancing}_{t}
    &= \text{Stock Value}_{t-1} \cdot (1+g) + \text{Bond Value}_{t-1} \cdot (1+r) \\
    \\
    \text{Required Portfolio}_{t}
    &= p_{x+t-1} \cdot \pi(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The expected required portfolio for that period is coming from a profit testing perspective, where it assumes all policies are **in-force at the beginning** of the year. Thus, it is similar to a reserve in the sense that the hedge portfolio only needs to be held for those **policies in-force** at the end of the year.

    The replicating portfolio functionally acts as a reserve that is released over time.

One other method to mitigate the investment risk is to **hold a reserve**. *IF* the reserve is sufficiently large, it can withstand the shock of a poor investment and thus mitigate the risk completely. This method is usually a much **cheaper** compared to purchasing options, at the cost of the risk not being completely mitigated.

!!! Tip

    More generally, there are many questions in the exam which asks for the **Pros and Cons** of DIY vs outsourcing via hedging or buying an annuity etc. The following logic can be applied to a wide range of situations:

    * Outsourcing eliminates the risk of negative experience, but also eliminates potential upside from positive experience
    * Outsourcing may be cheaper versus the cost of administering the program DIY
    * Outsourcing might be more expensive as the other party has baked in profit margins etc while DIY is the true cost

## **Variable Annuities**

In the US, rather than having Equity Linked Insurance, they offer **Variable Annuities** instead. They are a form of **Deferred Annuity** where the premiums paid are **invested into a mutual fund** of their choice. At the end of the policy term, they have the option to either:

* Receive the account value in **cash** (**Maturity Benefit**)
* Convert the amount into a **life annuity** (**Annuitization**)

!!! Warning

    Despite having an Annuity in its name, it is actually a **life insurance** policy before it becomes annuitized. A **death benefit is payable** if the insured dies during the policy term. Once annuitized, the death benefit is no longer payable.

    The policy term above refers to the term of the **variable annuity**. The annuity will have a seperately specified term.

Similar to Equity Linked insurance, variable annuities also offer guaranteed maturity and death benefits. However, they also offer **additional more complex guarantee features** than those described previously:

* Reset Option
* Lookback Option
* Rollover Guarantee

Additionally, since they have an annuity component, there are **additional annuity related guarantees**:

* Guaranteed Income Benefits
* Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefits

### **Reset Option**

**Reset Options** allow the policy to increase the guaranteed benefit amount to **match the account value** at the time of exercising the option. It will *only* be exercised if the account value has **increased beyond** the guaranteed amount:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Original Guarantee} &= \lambda \cdot P \\
    \text{Reset Guarantee} &= \lambda \cdot \text{AV at time of exercise}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The **same scaling factor** is applied for the new guarantee. Functionally, it is **changing the base of the guarantee**.

Policyholders have the **flexibility** to choose when to exercise the option, allowing them to time the market for a good amount. However, it comes with a "cost" of a **minimum policy term post exercising**:

* **Less than $k$ years left**: Remaining term increased to $k$ years
* **More than $k$ year left**: No change to remaining term

!!! Info

    The minimum term might come attached with a **Surrender Charge** condition if any amount is withdrawn then. This is to ensure that the insurer can recoup the costs associated with increasing the gurantee.

Apart from being competitive, there is another reason why such benefits are offered. If the account value is **significantly higher** than the guaranteed amount, the policyholder might surrender the policy and **reinvest in a new policy** with a higher guarantee - **incurring costs** related to cancelling and administering a new policy. Offering the option achieves the **same outcome with cost savings**.

However, such a complex guarantee does come with significant risks as well:

* If the entire market goes up, a **significant number will exercise** their reset option at once, resulting in a huge **increase in liability** for the insurer
* Similarly, they would **mature at similar times** (due to the minimum policy term), thus resulting in large **concentration risks**

### **Lookback Option**

**Lookback Options** will increase the gurantee amount to match the account value at **specific intervals**. Functionally, it is a reset option that will be **automatically exercised** (if in the money) every few years, but with no minimum policy term after.

$$
    \text{Lookback Guarantee} = \max (\text{AV}_{x}, \text{AV}_{2x}, \text{AV}_{3x}, \dots)
$$

While it provides **more opportunities** to reset the guarantee, it **loses the flexibility** to choose when it occurs. If the account value increases during the intervals but decreases before the specified time, the **peak will not be captured** by the option.

!!! Info

    This option is sometimes referred to as a **Step Up Guarantee**, as the guarantee has the potentially to be stepped up at regular intervals (assuming the fund value continuously increases).

### **Rollover Guarantee**

Rollover guarantees provide the following benefits at specified intervals:

* If the **account value is higher** than the guarantee, the **guarantee is increased** to match the account value
* If the **account value is lower** than the guarantee, the **account value is increased** to match the guarantee

!!! Info

    It is a essentially a lookback option with downside protection. It is also sometimes referred to as a **Guaranteed Accumulation Benefit**.

One key consideration is that if the policy has a rollover guarantee, it must be **projected seperately**. This is because the capital injections at the specified intervals will modify the account value, **affecting subsequent growth and charges**.

!!! Warning

    The capital injection by the insurer into the account value is **NOT considered part of the guaranteed benefits payout**. It should be thought of as a cost to the insurer. Thus, if asked to determine the payout of the option, **do NOT include any capital injections**.

### **Guaranteed Income Benefit**

A **Guaranteed Income Benefit** sets a **minimum payout** from the resulting annuity:

$$
    \text{Payout} = \max (\text{Payout}_\text{Market}, \text{Payout}_\text{GIB})
$$

The annuitization process can be broken down into two components:

* **Benefit Base**: Amount to be annuitized
* **Annuitization Rate**: Annuity EPV Factor

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Account Value} &= \text{Payout} \cdot \text{Annuity Factor} \\
    \text{Payout}
    &= \frac{\text{Account Value}}{\text{Annuity Factor}} \\
    &= \underbrace{\text{Account Value}}_{\text{Benefit Base}}
        \cdot \underbrace{\frac{1}{\text{Annuity Factor}}}_{\text{Annuitization Rate}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The guarantee can specify a change to **either or both of the components**, which affects the minimum payout:

* **Benefit Base**: Accumulate at different rate from account value (notional value; no charges)
* **Annuitization Rate**: Determined using different assumptions 

!!! Warning

    Most questions provide a scenario where one of the components is better while the other is worse than their market counterparts. There is insufficient information from this to determine if the guarantee is better or not; the combined effect needs to be considered.

The cost of this guarantee is the cost of actually fulfilling the payout - based on the **insurer's true expectation** of the future:

$$
    \text{Cost of Guarantee} = \text{Guaranteed Payout} \cdot \text{Market Annuity Factor}
$$

### **Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefit**

A **Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefit** ensures the policyholder can **ALWAYS withdraw** the specified amount from the fund, *within a specified period*.

Naturally, withdrawals will **reduce the account value** accordingly. However, even if the **account value is zero**, the policyholder **may still withdraw** the specified amount, as long as it is within the specified period. Hence, the term "always" was used earlier.

!!! Warning

    While the fund has value, the insurer may make withdrawals above the specified amount, **subject to the amount left** in the fund and any prevailing charges.

    Once the fund is depleted, the insurer can ONLY withdraw the specified amount - **no additional withdrawal** can be made, as there is nothing left to withdraw.

Any shortfall in the account value is **funded by the insurer**, which is the cost of the guarantee:

$$
    \text{Cost of Guarantee} = \sum \text{PV (Shortfall Funding)}
$$
