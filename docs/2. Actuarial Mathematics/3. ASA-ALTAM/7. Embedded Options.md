# **Embedded Options**

## **Overview**

Due to developments in the financial market, insurance products had to evolve to remain relevant. This led to development of **Unit Linked Insurance**, where policy benefits were **linked** to the performance of an **underlying mutual fund**.

In order to attract investors, these products usually come **guarantees** on their benefits, providing **unlimited upside and limited downsides**. However, this results in insurance companies bearing **huge financial risks**.

Traditional actuarial methods were not well suited to effectively deal with these risks, which led to the insolvency of many insurance companies in the 1990s when interest rates fell. This led to the creation of **Market Consistent** valuation basis to ensure that these risks are appropriately accounted for.

As its name suggests, market consistent valuation involves valuing an asset at its **observed market value**. However, insurance contracts are almost never traded, thus does not have an observable market value. Instead, the insurance cashflows are **translated into tradeable assets**, where the value of the contract is **equivalent to the price** of the assets.

The guarantees offered unit linked insurance can be translated into an **Option**, which is why it can be valued as an **Embedded Option**.

## **Unit Linked Insurance**

The defining feature of Unit Linked insurance is that the policyholder's premiums are **invested into units** of one or more mutual funds of the policyholder's choice. The **policy benefits are directly linked** to the total value of the units in the policyholder's account.

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to confuse universal life and unit linked policies as both involve an account for the policyholder.

    However, it is imperative to remember that the **universal life account is purely notional** while there **exists an actual account** for each policyholder under a unit linked policy.

### **Unit VS Non-Unit Account**

The key to understanding Unit Linked insurance is to understand the difference between:

* **Unit Account**: Owned by Policyholders; where premiums are invested
* **Non-Unit Account**: Owned by Company (Shareholders); where benefits and expenses are paid out from

Every period, **charges** are posted to the unit account to cover the cost of the policy (Mortality & Expense charges, similar to UL).

These charges then flow into the non-unit account as **fee income**, which is then used to cover the actual cost of the policy.

!!! Tip

    The amount charged to the policyholder and the actual cost of the policy **might be different**.

    For instance, the policyholder might have a fund management charge of $100. However, the insurer might actually only incur $70 in investment expenses, due to economies of scale.

    Thus, the insurer earns the spread of the above two items.

Another way to look at it is that for all other policies, there only exists a non-unit account. The premium received each period is used to cover associated costs. 

However, for a unit linked policy, rather than receive the premiums directly, they are first invested and only what is needed is deducted in each period.

!!! Warning

    Only **NON-unit** account cashflows should be used for **profit testing**.

     The confusion arises because unit account cashflows must be projected as well to obtain the charges.

### **Premium Allocation**

Only the Allocated Premium is used to purchase units; the remaining un allocated premium flows directly into the unit account.

The proportion of premium that is allocated is controlled by the Premium Allocation Rate.

$$
    \text{Allocated Premium} = \text{Premium} \cdot \text{Allocation Rate}
$$

!!! Tip

    It is possible for the allocation rate to be above 100%. The insurer will fund the additional amount in these cases.

When purchasing units, part of the value will be lost due to **Transactional Costs** such as the **Bid Offer Spread**:

* **Bid Price**: How much the fund manager is bidding for the unit (Sell price)
* **Offer Price**: How much the fund manager is asking for the unit (Buy price)

The units are purchased based on the Offer Price but values at the Bid Price.

Since Offer prices are always higher than bid prices, this leads to an immediate loss in value compared to the premium paid.

$$
    \text{Unit Value Purchased} = \text{Allocated Premium} \cdot (1 - \text{Bid Offer Spread})
$$

TBC proving the above 

### **Fund Value**

For the purposes of this exam, the fund value in each period can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
\text{Opening FV}
&+ \text{Allocated Premium} \\
&- \text{Expense Charges} \\
&- \text{Mortality Charges} \\
&+ \text{Interest Earned} \\
&- \text{Management Charges} \\
&= \text{Ending FV}
\end{aligned}
$$

For the purposes of this exam, the **methods** to calculate the above charges will be **specified by the question**. It is usually calculated as **percentage of the fund value**.

!!! Warning

    The above breakdown is based on what is commonly done in practice. It is possible for a question to have fewer cashflows or have them projected at different timings (EG. No mortality charge & Management Charge at BOP). 

### **Policy Benefits**

As mentioned previously, the benefits of the policy are **tied** to the value of the unit account.

$$
    \text{Death Benefit} = \text{Surrender Benefit} = \text{Account Value}
$$

However, due to the **volatile nature** of investing, some policyholders could end up with low fund values and hence low coverage. Thus, most policies offer a **guaranteed minimum benefit** that will kick in if the account value is below a certain threshold.

The most common variation is to offer a guaranteed minimum benefit based on some multiple of the **premiums paid to date**:

$$
     \text{Minimum Benefit} = \text{Lambda} \cdot \text{Premium Paid to Date}
$$

The guaranteed benefit will be paid **if the account value is smaller** than the guarantee. Thus, the benefit of the policy can be expressed as the **higher** of the two:

$$
    \text{Policy Benefit} = \max (\text{Account Value}, \text{Guaranteed Benefit})
$$
