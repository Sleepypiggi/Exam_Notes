# **Embedded Options**

## **Overview**

Due to developments in the financial market, insurance products had to evolve to remain relevant. This led to development of **Unit Linked Insurance**, where policy benefits were **linked** to the performance of an **underlying mutual fund**.

In order to attract investors, these products usually come **guarantees** on their benefits, providing **unlimited upside and limited downsides**. However, this results in insurance companies bearing **huge financial risks**.

Traditional actuarial methods were not well suited to effectively deal with these risks, which led to the insolvency of many insurance companies in the 1990s when interest rates fell. This led to the creation of **Market Consistent** valuation basis to ensure that these risks are appropriately accounted for.

As its name suggests, market consistent valuation involves valuing an asset at its **observed market value**. However, insurance contracts are almost never traded, thus does not have an observable market value. Instead, the insurance cashflows are **translated into tradeable assets**, where the value of the contract is **equivalent to the price** of the assets.

The guarantees offered unit linked insurance can be translated into an **Option**, which is why it can be valued as an **Embedded Option**.

## **Unit Linked Insurance**

The defining feature of Unit Linked insurance is that the policyholder's premiums are **invested into units** of one or more mutual funds of the policyholder's choice. The **policy benefits are directly linked** to the total value of the units in the policyholder's account.

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to confuse universal life and unit linked policies as both involve an **account** for the policyholder.

    However, it is imperative to remember that the **universal life account is purely notional** while there **exists an actual account** for each policyholder under a unit linked policy.

### **Unit VS Non-Unit Account**

The key to understanding Unit Linked insurance is to understand the difference between:

* **Unit Account**: Owned by Policyholders; where premiums are invested
* **Non-Unit Account**: Owned by Company (Shareholders); where benefits and expenses are paid out from

Every period, **charges** are posted to the unit account to cover the cost of the policy (Mortality & Expense charges, similar to UL).

These charges then flow into the non-unit account as **fee income**, which is then used to cover the actual cost of the policy.

![Unit_Linked](Assets/7.%20Embedded%20Options.md/Unit_Linked.png){.center}

!!! Tip

    The amount charged to the policyholder and the actual cost of the policy **might be different**. The charges are typically higher, allowing the insurer to **earn the difference**.

    For instance, the policyholder might have a fund management charge of $100. However, the insurer might actually only incur $70 in investment expenses, due to economies of scale.

!!! Warning

    Only **NON-unit** account cashflows should be used for **profit testing**.

    The confusion arises because unit account cashflows must be projected as well to obtain the charges.

Another intuitive way to think about it is that for **all other types of policies**, there exists only a **non-unit account**. The premiums paid might be more/less than the cost of the policy, the excess/shortfall is managed by the **insurer's investments**.

The key difference is that the premiums are **invested by the policyholder**; only what is needed is deducted each period. The **investment risk is borne by the policyholder** instead.

### **Premium Allocation**

Only the **Allocated Premium** is used to **purchase units**; the remaining un allocated premium flows directly into the unit account. The **proportion** of premium that is allocated is controlled by the **Allocation Rate**:

$$
    \text{Allocated Premium} = \text{Premium} \cdot \text{Allocation Rate}
$$

!!! Tip

    It is possible for the allocation rate to be *above* 100%. The insurer will fund the additional amount as an outflow.

When purchasing units, part of the value will be lost due to **Transactional Costs** such as the **Bid Offer Spread**:

* **Bid Price**: How much the fund manager is bidding for the unit (Sell price)
* **Offer Price**: How much the fund manager is asking for the unit (Buy price)

The units are purchased based on the Offer Price but values at the Bid Price. However, Offer prices are **always higher** than bid prices, this leads to an immediate **loss in value** compared to the premium paid:

$$
    \text{Unit Value Purchased} = \text{Allocated Premium} \cdot (1 - \text{Bid Offer Spread})
$$

TBC proving the above 

### **Fund Value**

For the purposes of this exam, the fund value in each period can be calculated as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
& \text{Opening FV} \\
&+ \text{Allocated Premium} \\
&- \text{Expense Charges} \\
&- \text{Mortality Charges} \\
&+ \text{Interest Earned} \\
&- \text{Management Charges} \\
&= \text{Ending FV}
\end{aligned}
$$

For the purposes of this exam, the **methods** and **timing** of the above cashflows will be **specified by the question**. They are all usually calculated as **percentage of the fund value** at different points (EG. Management Charges uses FV after interest etc).

<!-- Self Made -->
![Unit Fund](Assets/7.%20Embedded%20Options.md/Unit_Fund.png){.center}

!!! Warning

    The above breakdown is based on what is commonly done in practice. It is possible for a question to have fewer cashflows or have them projected at different timings (EG. No mortality charge & Management Charge at BOP). 

### **Policy Benefits**

As mentioned previously, the benefits of the policy are **tied** to the value of the unit account:

$$
    \text{Death Benefit} = \text{Surrender Benefit} = \text{Account Value}
$$

However, due to the **volatile nature** of investing, some policyholders could end up with **low fund values** and hence low coverage. Thus, most policies offer a **guaranteed minimum benefit** that will kick in **if the account value is below a certain threshold**.

The most common variation is to offer a guaranteed minimum benefit based on some multiple $\lambda$ of the **premiums paid to date**:

$$
     \text{Minimum Benefit} = \text{Lambda} \cdot \text{Premium Paid to Date}
$$

The guaranteed benefit will be paid **if the account value is smaller** than the guarantee. Thus, the benefit of the policy can be expressed as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Policy Benefit}
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        \text{Account Value}, & \text{Account Value} > \text{Guaranteed Benefit} \\
        \text{Guaranteed Benefit}, & \text{Account Value} <= \text{Guaranteed Benefit}
    \end{cases} \\
    &= \max (\text{Account Value}, \text{Guaranteed Benefit})
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Embedded Options**

With some manipulation, the above expression for policy benefit can be expressed in the form a **European Put Option Payoff**:

* Guaranteed Benefit is a **fixed value**, similar to the **Strike Price**
* Account Value follows a **stock price process** (with charges applied)

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Put Option Payoff}_{t}
    &= \max (K - S_{t}, 0) \\
    \\
    \text{Policy Benefit}_{t}
    &= \max (\text{AV}_{t}, \text{GB}) \\
    &= \max (\text{GB} - \text{AV}_{t}, \text{AV}_{t} - \text{AV}_{t}) \\
    &= \max (\text{GB} - \text{AV}_{t}, 0)
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the same framework used to evaluate european put options - **Black Scholes Merton** model - can be used to evaluate these guaranteed benefits as well. However, there is one **key difference** between the two that must be accounted for:

* **Regular Option**: Time to expiration (when the option is exercised) is **fixed**
* **Embedded Option**: Time is **contingent** on the survival/death of the policyholder

Thus, the framework must be adjusted slightly to account for the **probabilities of death/survival** within the given timeframe.

!!! Note

    Please refer to the **Derivatives Section** of the IFM notes for more information on European Options and the Black Scholes model.

Unless otherwise stated, all policies referenced in this section are assumed to be **Single Premium** policies with **no additional top ups**.

### **Guaranteed Maturity Benefit**

The maturity benefit is paid at a **known time** (at the **end of the policy term**), given that the policyholder is **alive at that time**.

For simplicity, assume that the policy has a **Guaranteed Minimum Maturity Benefit** (GMMB) of some **multiple of premiums paid**:

$$
    \text{GMMB} = \lambda P
$$

!!! Note

    The expression is simplified in this case since we assume a single premium policy.

The account value projection earlier assumes that the fund grows at a **specified rate**. An alternative method is to assume that it grows at the same rate as an **underlying stock process**. Thus, the account value **at maturity** of time $n$ can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{AV}_{n}
    &= \text{Opening Value} \cdot \text{Charges} \cdot \text{Growth} \\
    &= P \cdot (1 - \text{IC}) \cdot (1 - \text{RC})^{n-1} \cdot \frac{S_{n}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P \cdot \xi \cdot \frac{S_{n}}{S_{0}} \\
    \\
    \xi &= (1 - \text{IC}) \cdot (1 - \text{RC})^{n-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The charges in this scenario have have been simplified to **Initial Charges** (IC) and **Renewal Charges** (RC). Both are charged as a **percentage of the account value** at the time.

    They are then further **combined** into $xi$, since they have a **fixed value** (dependent only on policy term, which is fixed for each policy).

    <!-- Self Made TBC, simple timeline with IC, RC, RC, then xi -->

Thus, the **embedded option payoff** $h(t)$ can be expressed as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    h(t)
    &= \max (\text{GB} - \text{AV}_{n}, 0) \\
    &= \max  \left(\lambda P - P \cdot \xi \cdot \frac{S_{n}}{S_{0}} \right) \\
    &= P \xi \cdot \max \left(\frac{\lambda}{\xi} - \frac{S_{n}}{S_{0}} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    The above can be intepreted as requiring $P \xi$ put options with strike price $\frac{\lambda}{\xi}$.

Using the Black Scholes Merton framework, the price (value) of **ONE** of the above put options **on inception** can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    P(0)
    &= \frac{\lambda}{\xi} \cdot e^{-rn} \Phi [-d_{2}(0)] - S_{0} \cdot \Phi [-d_{1}(0)] \\
    \\
    d_{1}(0)
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{0}}{\frac{\lambda}{\xi}} + (r + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) n}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} \\
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{0} \xi}{\lambda} + (r + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) n}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} \\
    &= d_{2}(0) + \sigma \sqrt{n} \\
    \\
    d_{2}(0)
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{0}}{\frac{\lambda}{\xi}} + (r - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) n}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} \\
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{0} \xi}{\lambda}+ (r - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) n}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} \\
    &= d_{1}(0) - \sigma \sqrt{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    $\Phi(x)$ represents the CDF of the standard normal distribution at $x$. It can be determined via the NORM.S.DIST **Excel Function**.

Thus, the **value of the guarantee** $\pi(0)$ must reflect the following items:

* **Number** of options needed, $P \xi$
* **Probability** of surviving till maturity ${}_{n}P_{x}$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \pi(0)
    &= {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot P \xi \cdot P(0) \\
    &= {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot P \xi
        \cdot \left(\frac{\lambda}{\xi} \cdot e^{-rn} \Phi [-d_{2}(0)] - S_{0} \cdot \Phi [-d_{1}(0)] \right) \\
    &= {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot P \cdot (\lambda \cdot e^{-rn} \Phi [-d_{2}(0)] - \xi S_{0} \cdot \Phi [-d_{1}(0)])
\end{aligned}
$$

The above is the **price of the guarantee** on inception. From a reserving perspective, the value of the guarantee **at a specified time** is required:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \pi(t)
    &= {}_{n-t}p_{x+t} \cdot P \cdot (\lambda \cdot e^{-r(n-t)} \Phi [-d_{2}(t)] - \xi S_{t} \cdot \Phi [-d_{1}(t)]) \\
    \\
    d_{1}(t)
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{t} \xi}{\lambda} + (r + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) (n-t)}{\sigma \sqrt{n-t}} \\
    &= d_{2}(t) + \sigma \sqrt{n-t} \\
    \\
    d_{2}(t)
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{t} \xi}{\lambda}+ (r - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) (n-t)}{\sigma \sqrt{n-t}} \\
    &= d_{1}(t) - \sigma \sqrt{n-t}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    The above is obtained going through the **same process**, just that the **valuation date** is time $t$ instead of time $0$, which affects the following:

    * **Time to Maturity**: Changed from $n$ to $n-t$
    * **Initial Stock Price**: Changed from $S_{0}$ to $S_{t}$
  
    Note that $\xi$ **does NOT** depend on the time to maturity, thus does not need to be changed.

### **Guaranteed Death Benefit**

The death benefit is paid at an **unknown time** depending on when the policyholder dies. This adds **another layer** to the analysis as the **possibility of death at every possible time** must be considered.

The value of the guarantee is thus the combination of the following items:

* **Gurantee value** at each possible payout period
* **Discount factor** for each of the above
* **Probability of payout** (death) for each of the above

!!! Tip

    Notice that the above is analagous to the **triple sumproduct** of the EPV. Both follow the **same intuition**.

The value of the guarantee for **each possible period** $n$ can be expressed as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    V(0, n)
    &= P \xi \cdot P(0, n) \\
    \\
    P(0, n)
    &= \frac{\lambda}{\xi} \cdot e^{-rn} \Phi [-d_{2}(0, n)] - S_{0} \cdot \Phi [-d_{1}(0, n)] \\
    \\
    d_{1}(0, n)
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{0}}{\frac{\lambda}{\xi}} + (r + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) n}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} \\
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{0} \xi}{\lambda} + (r + \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) n}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} \\
    &= d_{2}(0, n) + \sigma \sqrt{n} \\
    \\
    d_{2}(0, n)
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{0}}{\frac{\lambda}{\xi}} + (r - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) n}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} \\
    &= \frac{\ln \frac{S_{0} \xi}{\lambda}+ (r - \frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2}) n}{\sigma \sqrt{n}} \\
    &= d_{1}(0, n) - \sigma \sqrt{n}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Notice that the option price formula is **exactly the same formula** as before, just that $n$ is treated as a **variable rather than a constant**. This is because the time to maturity is known while the time to death is not, thus **all possibilities** are considered.

The value of the guarantee on whole is the **expected value** of the guarantee values in each period:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \pi(0)
    &= \int p(0, n) \cdot {}_{n}p_{x} \mu_{x}(t) \\
    &= \sum P(0, n) \cdot {}_{k \mid}q_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    In the previous section, only one period needed to be considered. Thus, the number of options and probability of payout were combined into a single step. However, when considering multiple periods, it is **easier to split** them into two steps instead:

    * $V(0,n)$: Account for **number of options** needed for each period
    * $\pi(0)$: Account for **probability** of payment in each period

Similar to before, the above expression can be adjusted to determine the value of the guarantee at a specified period for reserving purposes. It can also be adjusted for benefits that are paid monthly as well.

### **Funding**

The cost of the guarantee is passed down to the policyholder in one of two ways:

* **Front-End Load**: Deducted **once** on inception
* **Risk Premium** ($\text{RP}$): Deducted **routinely** as part of the **management charges** ($\text{MC}$)

The front end approach is intuitive - the value of the guarantee $\pi(0)$ is deducted from the single premium alongside the initial charges on inception.

The risk premium approach requires us to determine the **proportion of the fund value** to be charged each period:

* **Total Management Charge Rate** ($m$), *including* the risk premium for the guarantee
* **Management Charge Rate** ($m^*$), *exclusing* the risk premium
* **Risk Premium Rate** ($c$)

$$
    m = m^* + c
$$

Consider a **general expression for the fund value** in each period:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    F_{0} &= P \\
    \\
    \text{RP}_{1} &= cP \\
    \text{MC}_{1} &= m^{*}P \\
    \therefore F_{1}
    &= (F_{0} - \text{RP}_{1} - \text{MC}_{1}) \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= [P - cP- m^{*}P] \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P(1 - c - m^{*}) \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P(1 - (c+m^{*})) \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P(1-m) \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}} \\
    \\
    \text{RP}_{2} &= cP(1-m) \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}}\\
    \text{MC}_{1} &= m^{*}P(1-m) \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}}\\
    \therefore F_{2}
    &= (F_{1} - \text{RP}_{2} - \text{MC}_{2}) \cdot \frac{S_{2}}{S_{1}} \\
    &= [P(1-m) - cP(1-m) - m^{*}P(1-m)] \cdot \frac{S_{1}}{S_{0}} \cdot \frac{S_{2}}{S_{1}} \\
    &= P(1-m) [1 - c - m^{*}] \cdot \frac{S_{2}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P(1-m)[1- (c+m^{*})] \cdot \frac{S_{2}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P(1-m)(1-m) \cdot \frac{S_{2}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P(1-m)^{2} \cdot \frac{S_{2}}{S_{0}} \\
    \\
    \therefore F_{t}
    &= P(1-m)^{t} \cdot \frac{S_{t}}{S_{0}} \\
    &= P(1-m)^{t} \cdot S_{t}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The above might seem redundant as it ultimately decomposes into the same Charges and Growth expressed previously. The point WAS to show that even under the current setup, the process does not change.

!!! Warning

    Under the above expression, the growth factor $\frac{S_{t}}{S_{0}}$ is using the cumulative **growth from inception**, as the **starting fund value** $P$ is used.

!!! Tip

    Since the **growth rate** is considered, we set $S_{0}$ to **1 for simplicity**. This assumption should be used for the remainder of the section.

Thus, we can obtain the risk premium charged in each period. However, since the amount to charge needs to be determined at inception, we need to consider its EPV:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{RP}_{t} &= c \cdot P(1-m)^{t} \cdot S_{t} \\
    \text{PV(RP)}_{t} &= c \cdot P(1-m)^{t} \\
    \text{EPV(RP)}
    &= \sum^{n-1}_{0} c \cdot P(1-m)^{t} {}_{t}p_{x} \\
    &= cP \sum^{n-1}_{0} (1-m)^{t} {}_{t}p_{x} \\
    &= cP \sum^{n-1}_{0} (v^{*})^{t} {}_{t}p_{x} \\
    &= cP \cdot \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n} i^{*}} \\
    \\
    v^{*} &= (1-m) \\
    \frac{1}{1+i^{*}} &= (1-m) \\
    1+i^{*} &= \frac{1}{1-m} \\
    i^{*} &= 1 - \frac{1}{1-m} \\
    i^{*} &= \frac{1-m-1}{1-m} \\
    i^{*} &= \frac{m}{1-m}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Under a **risk neutral assumption**, the present value of the stock price is the value at inception, which we have assumed to be 1.

    Additionally, note that limits of the summation **start from 0** and end at $n-1$, as the first risk premium charge does not include any prior management charges (they are **charged at the same time**).

The EPV of the risk premium and the cost of the guarantee should be the **same**, allowing us to solve for the risk premium rate:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \pi(0) &= cP \cdot \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n} i^{*}} \\
    c &= \frac{\pi(0)}{P \cdot \ddot{a}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n} i^{*}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    If the question specifies a risk premium rate and asks to calculate for the cost of the guarantee, it **might NOT equate** to the cost of the guarantee if it were calculated in a bottom's up manner.

### **Hedging**

Given that the guaranteed benefits follow the payoff of a european put option, the insurer can **completely hedge the risk** by investing in a **replicating portfolio** of stocks and zero-coupon bonds. Whenever the option is exercised, the insurer can **liquidate the replicating portfolio to completely cover** the payoff of the option.

The intuition can be found in the **Option Greeks** section of exam IFM. However, the actual derivation is **much more complicated** in this case due to the inclusion of probability etc. For the purposes of this exam, it is sufficient to **memorize the formulas** instead.

!!! Note

    Other than making their own replicating portfolio, the insurer can also purchase the put option(s) from a third party with the exact strike price and time to maturity. However, this **may not be feasible** as the options with *exact parameters* might not exist.

    Similarly, we will only consider hedging GMMBs, as **only one put option** needs to be hedged. For GMDBs, a **set of put options** need to be replicated for each possible period that the policyholder could die.

The value of the put option can be decomposed into a portfolio of stocks and bonds:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \Delta S_{0} + B_{0}
    &= \pi(0) \\
    \\
    \Delta S_{0} + B_{0}
    &=  {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot P \cdot (\lambda \cdot e^{-rn} \Phi [-d_{2}(0)] - \xi S_{0} \cdot \Phi [-d_{1}(0)]) \\
    \\
    \therefore \Delta_{t} &= {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot P \cdot \xi \cdot \Phi [-d_{1}(0)] \\
    \therefore B_{0} &= {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot P \cdot \lambda \cdot e^{-rn} \Phi [-d_{2}(0)]
\end{aligned}
$$

It can be understood more intuitively if expressed slightly differently:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \pi(0)
    &= {}_{n}p_{x} \cdot P \xi
        \cdot \left(\frac{\lambda}{\xi} \cdot e^{-rn} \Phi [-d_{2}(0)] - S_{0} \cdot \Phi [-d_{1}(0)] \right) \\
    &= \text{Number of Puts} \\
    &\cdot (\text{Value of Bond per Put} - S_{0} \cdot \text{Number of Stock per Put})
\end{aligned}
$$

In theory, the replicating portfolio under the BSM framework should be **self financing** - it does not need to be rebalanced in every period. However, in practice, the insurer needs to be rebalance the portfolio as there could be deviation from assumptions used. This incurs additional **hedging costs** that must be accounted for when determining profit.

## **Variable Annuities**

In the US, rather than having Unit Linked Insurance, they offer **Variable Annuities** instead.

They are a form of **Deferred Annuity** where the premiums paid are **invested into a mutual fund** of their choice. At the end of the accumulation period, the fund can be withdrawn as Cash Value or converted into a Life Annuity.

### **Reset Option**

Reset the guarantee to match the value of the fund on the reset date
Relevant if the fund value has increased since then

### **Lookback Option**

Similar to reset but at specific dates

### **Guaranteed Accumulation Benefit**

Same as reset but will increase fund value if below

### **Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefit**

### **Guaranteed Income Benefit**

### **Guaranteed Withdrawal Benefit**
