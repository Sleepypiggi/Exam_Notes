# **Universal Life**

Universal Life policies are a special type of life insurance policies known for their **flexibility**. They provide policyholders with the ability to **choose how much premiums** they want to pay and how much benefits to receive, allowing them to effectively create a policy that is **customized** to their specific needs.

## **Account Value**

The defining feature of a universal life policy is that every policy has an account associated with it:

* Policyholders **choose how much premium** to deposit into the account (subject to some **minimum requirements**)
* Insurer posts **Expenses charges** to the account to cover the costs to maintain the policy
* Insurer posts **Mortality charges** to the account to cover the cost of providing insurance coverage
* Insurer **credits interest** into the account (subject to some **minimum rate**)

    \text{AV}_{t}
    &= (\text{AV}_{t-1} + P - e - \text{COI}_{t})(1 + i^{c}) \\
    \\
    \text{COI}_{t}
    &= (\text{DB} - \text{AV}_{t}) \cdot q^{*}_{x+t-1} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + i^{q}} \\
    &= \text{ADB} \cdot q^{*}_{x+t-1} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + i^{q}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It looks similar to the profit calculation but one key difference is that the **interest is earned on the entire balance**, not just the beginning of period cashflows.

!!! Info

    The account is purely **notional** - the insurer does not hold seperate assets for each account; they are kept entirely within the general account of the company. The insurer reviews their  investment return to decide how much interest to credit the UL account.

    Policyholders will receive **account statements** detailing account transactions. This provides **transparency** to the policyholders, allowing them to easily distinguish between the insurance and savings component of the policy.

## **Sum At Risk**

The policy provides two benefits:

<center>

| **Death Benefit** | **Surrender Benefit** |
| :---------------: | :-------------------: |
|    Upon Death     |      Upon lapse       |
| Specified Amount  |     Account Value     |

</center>

It is important to understand that these two benefits are mutually exclusive; a policyholder can only receive one of them. Thus, if a **death claim** is made, the **account value** can be used to offset the amount since it is **no longer needed** to pay a potential survival benefit.

Thus, the amount of insurance coverage provided (amount that the insurer pays out of pocket) is the **difference** between the death benefit and account value, known as the **Sum at Risk** (also known as the **Additional Death Benefit**):

$$
    \text{Sum at Risk} = \text{Death Benefit} - \text{Account Value}
$$

The mortality charge is the **pure cost** of providing insurance **for that period** - the **expected outgo** from that benefit. Since the insurer only pays the SAR, the mortality charge is calculated based off it:

$$
    \text{Mortality Charge}_{x} = \text{Sum at Risk} \cdot q^{*}_{x+t} \cdot \frac{1}{1+i^{q}}
$$

!!! Warning

    Since the COI is dependent on the ending account value in that period, it **cannot be calculated separately**. Thus, it is recommended to stick to the **general rollover formula** shared above rather than attempt to calculate the components seperately.

!!! Note

    Intuitively, it is essentially the pure premium charged for the insurance. Premiums must always be paid at the start of the period, thus it is charged at the start.

    However, the actual death cashflow will only be known at the end of the period. Thus, the the amount must be calculated as at the end of the period and **discounted back**.

    The discount rate used for CAN be different from the credited interest rate. This is why the two have different notations ($i^{q}$ and $i^{c}$).

## **Death Benefit**

There are two types of universal life policies in terms of their **Death Benefit** (DB) structure:

* **Type A**: Level death benefit; variable sum at risk
* **Type B**: Variable death benefit; level sum at risk

!!! Warning

    The above diagram assumes that the account value will always increase over time. While this is a reasonable expectation, the account value **could decrease** over time as well if insufficient premiums are paid.

Under a Type A plan, the account value could **increase beyond the death benefit**. If the death benefit stays level, the SAR would be negative, which goes against the principles of insurance. Thus, the death benefit **MUST increase proportionally** to the account value - known as a **Corridor Factor**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Death Benefit}_{c} &= (1 + \gamma) \cdot \text{Account Value} \\
    \therefore \text{Death Benefit} &= \max (\text{Death Benefit}_{c}, \text{Death Benefit}_{nc})   
\end{aligned}
$$

Similar expressions can be found for the other components, but it is much easier to approach these type of situations using first principles.

## **Surrender Benefit**

There are **high acquisition costs** associated with setting up an insurance policy, which is **recovered over the lifetime** of the policy. However, if the policyholder surrenders the policy early on, the insurer loses the opportunity to recover these costs.

Thus, insurers usually impose a **Surrender Charge** on the policy if the insured surrenders the policy in the first few years from inception. It can either be **pre-determined amount** or **proportional** to the account value. In either case, the charge decreases over time to 0 as the insurer has recovered the costs.

$$
    \text{Surrender Benefit} = \max (0, \text{Account Value} - \text{Surrender Charge})
$$

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to **forget to floor** the surrender value - especially for questions where there are multiple scenarios and the weighted surrender benefit is calculated.

    This is because if calculating the surrender value alone, a negative surrender value would flag out. However, when combined, there would be some **offsetting impact** from the other scenarios.

## **No Lapse Guarantee**

Given that policyholders have the liberty to choose their own premiums, they could theoretically underfund the policy, causing the account value to **decrease to 0** over time, causing the policy to **automatically lapse**.

In order to hedge against such a situation, some UL policies offer a **No Lapse Guarantee** (NLG) feature, where the policy would **remain in-force** even if the account value reaches 0.

!!! Info

    There are usually some conditions tagged to the NLG feature, such as requiring the insured to have paid some **minimum level** of premium.

The NLG feature will provide coverage equal to what the **underlying policy** would have, typically up to some **maximum age**. Thus, the NLG feature can be valued the same way as a **term insurance** policy.

If the value of NLG feature is larger than the account value of the policy at the time, the insurer must hold an **additional reserve** equal to the difference:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV(NLG)} &= \text{Death Benefit} \cdot A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
    \therefore {}_{t}V^{\text{NLG}} &= \max(0, \text{EPV(NLG)} - \text{Account Value})
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Scenario Testing**

One common type of questions asks for the change in the account value **given a change one of the assumptions**. To effectively tackle these questions, the following relationship can be used:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Account Value}
    &= \text{Accumulated Premiums} \\
    &- \text{Accumulated Expenses} \\
    &- \text{Accumulated COI} \\
    \\
    \text{Accumulated Premiums}
    &= \text{Premium} \cdot s_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
    &= \text{Premium} \cdot \frac{(1+i)^{n}-1}{i}
\end{aligned}
$$

Using this method, only the **affected component** needs to be changed. This can be used to handle assumption changes that impact only **certain years**.

!!! Note

    This method is usually more useful for type B plans with **constant SAR**.
