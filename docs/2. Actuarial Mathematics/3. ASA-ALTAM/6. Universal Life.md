# **Universal Life**

## **Account Value**

The defining feature of a universal life policy is that every policy has an account associated with it:

* Policyholders **choose how much premium** to deposit into the account (subject to some **minimum requirements**)
* Insurer posts **Expenses charges** to the account to cover the costs to maintain the policy
* Insurer posts **Mortality charges** to the account to cover the cost of providing insurance coverage
* Insurer **credits interest** into the account (subject to some **minimum rate**)

!!! Info

    The account is purely **notional** - the insurer does not hold seperate assets for each account.

    Policyholders will receive **account statements** detailing account transactions. This provides **transparency** to the policyholders, allowing them to easily distinguish between the insurance and savings component of the policy.

### **Sum At Risk**

The policy provides two benefits:

<center>

|  Death Benefit   | Surrender Benefit |
| :--------------: | :---------------: |
|    Upon Death    |    Upon lapse     |
| Specified Amount |   Account Value   |

</center>

It is important to understand that these two benefits are mutually exclusive; a policyholder can only receive one of them. Thus, if a **death claim** is made, the **account value** can be used to offset the amount since it is **no longer needed** to pay a potential survival benefit.

Thus, the amount of insurance coverage provided (amount that the insurer pays out of pocket) is the **difference** between the death benefit and account value, known as the **Sum at Risk** (also known as the **Additional Death Benefit**):

$$
    \text{Sum at Risk} = \text{Death Benefit} - \text{Account Value}
$$

The mortality charge is the **pure cost** of providing insurance - the **expected outgo** from that benefit. Since the insurer only pays the SAR, the mortality charge is calculated based off it:

$$
    \text{Mortality Charge}_{x} = \text{Sum at Risk} \cdot v^{*}q^{*}_{x}
$$

!!! Warning

    Note that the both the interest and mortality rates used above **may be DIFFERENT** from the ones used in the main projection.

Note that since the account value changes every period, so does the SAR and hence the mortality charge. Thus, the mortality charge can be understood as the cost of providing a **one-year term insurance** cover with face amount equal to the SAR.
