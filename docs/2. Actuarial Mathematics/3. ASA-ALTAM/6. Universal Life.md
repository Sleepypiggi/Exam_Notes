# **Universal Life**

Universal Life policies are a special type of life insurance policies known for their **flexibility**. They provide policyholders with the ability to **choose how much premiums** they want to pay and how much benefits to receive, allowing them to effectively create a policy that is **customized** to their specific needs.

## **Account Value**

The defining feature of a universal life policy is that every policy has an account associated with it:

* Policyholders **choose how much premium** to deposit into the account (subject to some **minimum requirements**)
* Insurer posts **Expenses charges** to the account to cover the costs to maintain the policy
* Insurer posts **Mortality charges** to the account to cover the cost of providing insurance coverage
* Insurer **credits interest** into the account (**proportion** of actual return, subject to some **minimum rate**)

!!! Warning

    It looks similar to the profit calculation but one key difference is that the **interest is earned on the entire balance**, not just the beginning of period cashflows.

!!! Info

    The account is purely **notional** - the insurer does not hold seperate assets for each account; they are kept entirely within the general account of the company. The insurer reviews their  investment return to decide how much interest to credit the UL account.

    Policyholders will receive **account statements** detailing account transactions. This provides **transparency** to the policyholders, allowing them to easily distinguish between the insurance and savings component of the policy.

The above can be calculated in Excel and presented as the following:

## **Cost of Insurance**

The policy provides two benefits:

<center>

| **Death Benefit** | **Surrender Benefit** |
| :---------------: | :-------------------: |
|    Upon Death     |      Upon lapse       |
| Specified Amount  |     Account Value     |

</center>

It is important to understand that these two benefits are mutually exclusive; a policyholder can only receive one of them. Thus, if a **death claim** is made, the **account value** can be used to offset the amount since it is **no longer needed** to pay a potential survival benefit.

Thus, the amount of insurance coverage provided (amount that the **insurer pays out of pocket**) is the **difference** between the death benefit and account value, known as the **Sum at Risk** (also known as the **Additional Death Benefit**):

$$
    \text{SAR} = \text{Death Benefit} - \text{Account Value}
$$

The **Cost of Insurance** (COI) is the cost of providing life insurance coverage equal to the SAR for that one year. It is equal to the **expected outgo** of the SAR:

$$
    \text{COI}_{t} = \text{SAR} \cdot q^{*}_{x+t-1} \cdot \frac{1}{1 + i^{q}}
$$

Intuitively, it is essentially the **pure premium** charged for the insurance, which must be paid at the **start of the period**. However, the actual death cashflow will only be known at the end of the period. Thus, the the amount must be calculated as at the end of the period and **discounted back** to obtain the pure cost.

!!! Warning

    The discount rate used for **CAN be different** from the credited interest rate. This is why the two have different notations ($i^{q}$ and $i^{c}$).

    If not seperately specified, assume that the it follows the credited interest rate.

!!! Tip

    Notice that the COI is dependent on the AV, which is in turn dependent on the COI; there is a **circular dependency**:

    <!-- Self Made -->
    ![COI Circular Reference](Assets/6.%20Universal%20Life.md/COI_Circular.png){.center}

    Thus, it is NOT possible to calculate the COI seperately and plugged into the AV calculation. They must be **combined into a one large equation** where the AV is solved for.

    If using excel, setting up the equation will throw a **circular reference error**. There are two ways around this:

    * Enable **Iterative Calculations** (Changes Excel behaviour to **accept the loop**)
    * Create a **seperate AV variable** and use **Goalseek** to set them equal (**Manually close** the loop)

    <!-- Self Made -->

    It is **safer to use the second approach** as turning on iterative calculations might have unintended side effects. However, note that the goalseek must be **done for each policy year** and must be **repeated for any change** in the setup.

## **Corridoor Factor**

There are two types of universal life policies in terms of their **Death Benefit** (DB) structure:

<center>

|        **Type A**         |       **Type B**       |
| :-----------------------: | :--------------------: |
| Pre-Defined Death Benefit | Variable Death Benefit |
|      Decreasing SAR       |       Fixed SAR        |

!!! Info

    The above diagram assumes that the account value will always increase over time. While this is a reasonable expectation, the account value **could decrease** over time as well if insufficient premiums are paid.

UL policies are still fundamentally an **insurance** product, not an **investment product**. Thus, the policy must ensure that **significant isurance benefit** is provided. This is achieved via a **Corridoor** ($\gamma$) - which is the **minimum ratio** of the death benefit to the account value:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \gamma
    &= \frac{\text{DB}_{t}}{\text{AV}_{t}} \\
    &= \frac{\text{AV}_{t} + \text{SAR}_{t}}{\text{AV}_{t}} \\
    &= 1 + \frac{\text{SAR}_{t}}{\text{AV}_{t}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The corridoor is applicable to **BOTH type A and type B** policies:

* Type A policies tend to be more impacted as the SAR decreases over time, causing it to **fall below the minimum threshold** in the later years
* Type B policies have a fixed SAR, thus are **unlikely to be impacted** unless the account value grows to extremely large size

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{DB}_{t, c} &= (1 + \gamma) \cdot \text{AV}_{t} \\
    \therefore \text{DB}_{t} &= \max (\text{DB}_{t, c}, \text{DB}_{t, nc})   
\end{aligned}
$$

The presence of a corridoor poses a challenge in terms of how to calculate the account value. This because the target variable (account value) is part of a maximum function. Thus, the following steps must be taken to determine the correct account value:

* Solve for the account value assuming there is **NO corridoor**
* Check the ratio of DB to AV
* If **larger than the corridoor**, use the **previously calculated AV** as the final AV for the period
* If **smaller than the corridoor**, recalculate the AV assuming the corridoor applies; use the resulting AV as the final AV for the period

!!! Note

    The same approach can be used from before. Simply update the death benefit logic to account for the Corridoor:

## **Surrender Benefit**

There are **high acquisition costs** associated with setting up an insurance policy, which is **recovered over the lifetime** of the policy. However, if the policyholder surrenders the policy early on, the insurer loses the opportunity to recover these costs.

Thus, insurers usually impose a **Surrender Charge** on the policy if the insured surrenders the policy in the first few years from inception. It can either be **pre-determined amount** or **proportional** to the account value. In either case, the charge decreases over time to 0 as the insurer has recovered the costs.

$$
    \text{Surrender Benefit} = \max (\text{Account Value} - \text{Surrender Charge}, 0)
$$

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to **forget to floor** the surrender value - especially for questions where there are multiple scenarios and the weighted surrender benefit is calculated.

    This is because if calculating the surrender value alone, a negative surrender value would flag out. However, when combined, there would be some **offsetting impact** from the other scenarios.

## **No Lapse Guarantee**

Given that policyholders have the liberty to choose their own premiums, they could theoretically underfund the policy, causing the account value to **decrease to 0** over time, causing the policy to **automatically lapse**.

In order to hedge against such a situation, some UL policies offer a **No Lapse Guarantee** (NLG) feature, where the policy would **remain in-force** even if the account value reaches 0.

!!! Info

    There are usually some conditions tagged to the NLG feature, such as requiring the insured to have paid some **minimum level** of premium.

The NLG feature will provide coverage equal to what the **underlying policy** would have, typically up to some **maximum age**. Thus, the NLG feature can be valued the same way as a **term insurance** policy.

If the value of NLG feature is larger than the account value of the policy at the time, the insurer must hold an **additional reserve** equal to the difference:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV(NLG)} &= \text{Death Benefit} \cdot A^{1}_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
    \therefore {}_{t}V^{\text{NLG}} &= \max(0, \text{EPV(NLG)} - \text{Account Value})
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Scenario Testing**

One common type of questions asks for the change in the account value **given a change one of the assumptions**. To effectively tackle these questions, the following relationship can be used:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Account Value}
    &= \text{Accumulated Premiums} \\
    &- \text{Accumulated Expenses} \\
    &- \text{Accumulated COI}
\end{aligned}
$$

The key intuition is that the components of Account value are **mostly independent** of one another (excluding COI). Thus, a change in one of the assumptions should only influence that particular component - there is no need to re-calculate ALL components.

For instance, if there is a change in the Y3 COI rate, then only the Y3 COI cashflow needs to be recalculated. Then, determine the impac to the accumulated COI and apply that to the existing account value.

!!! Tip
    
    If the cashflow and credited interest rate is **constant**, then the account value at any time can be found using accumulation functions:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{Accumulated Cashflow}
        &= \text{Cashflow} \cdot s_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} \\
        &= \text{Cashflow} \cdot \frac{(1+i^{c})^{n}-1}{i^{c}}        
    \end{aligned}
    $$
