# **Multiple Decrement Model**

## **Overview**

In FAM-L, we only considered simple insurance policies which paid **only** a death benefit. In reality, insurance contracts often pay **one of a few** possible benefits:

<center>

|         Benefit          |          Trigger          |
| :----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
|      Death Benefit       |  Death by natural causes  |
| Accidental Death Benefit |     Death by accident     |
|    Surrender Benefit     |    Lapsing the policy     |
|  Dread Disease Benefit   | Contracting Dread Disease |

</center>

!!! Note

    Functionally, multi-decrement models can be understood as a **one to many multi-state model**.

    For the purposes of this exam, unless otherwise stated, it is assumed that these type of policies only pay ONE of the benefits. Making a claim on either of the benefits will trigger a claim and then **terminate the policy**.

The different benefit triggers are **different ways that the policy can terminate**, known as a **Decrement**. Thus, the simple policy considered in FAM-L is an example of a **Single Decrement Model** while the policy described above is an example of a **Multiple Decrement Model**.

!!! Info

    The definition of a Decrement is "to decrease". In the context of life insurance, it decreases the number of active policies.

## **Probability**

Previously, since death was the only decrement, we only considered the probability of death. However, in a multiple decrement setting, we more generally consider the **probability of termination**.

The multiple decrement model has two components:

* **Discrete Random Variable $J$** - Denoting the decrements in the model
* **Continuous Random Variable $T$** - Denoting the time to termintaton based on that decrement

Combining the two, the probability of termination in $t$ years due to a **particular decrement** $j$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
    &= P(T_{x} \lt t, J_{x} = j) \\
    &= \int^{t}_{0} f_{T_{x}, J_{x}}(t, j)
\end{aligned}
$$

The probability of termination due to **ANY DECREMENT** in $t$ years is the sum of all individual probabilities of all $m$ decrements:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= {}_{t}q^{(1)}_{x} + {}_{t}q^{(2)}_{x} + \dots + {}_{t}q^{(m)}_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{j=m}_{j=1} {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    $\tau$ is the notation used the denote **ALL** possible decrements.

    The above is valid because we assumed that the policyholder can only terminate from ONE of the decrements. Thus, each decrement is **mutually exclusive**, where the probability of termination from any cause is the sum of each individual probability (OR logic).

Thus, the probability of surviving $t$ years is denoted as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= 1 - {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x} \\
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(\tau)}_{x+t}} 
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    There is NO such thing as ${}_{t}p^{(j)}_{x}$!

    The above would be the probability of surviving $t$ years from decrement $j$. However, even if they do not terminate from decrement $j$, they **can still terminate from OTHER decrements**.

    Ultimately, we are **only concerned whether the individual is still alive at time $t$**, not whether or not they survive a *particular* decrement.

The **force of decrement** has similar properties as the termination probability:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t)
    &= \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    \\
    \mu^{(\tau)}_{x}(t)
    &= \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{1}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}
       \left (\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x} \right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}
       \frac{d}{dt} \left[{}_{t}q^{(1)}_{x} + \dots {}_{t}q^{(m)}_{x} \right] \\
    &= \mu^{(1)}_{x+t} + \dots + \mu^{(m)}_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the PDF of the joint distribution can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t) &= \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    \frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} &= {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot  \mu^{(j)}_{x+t} \\
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} &= \int^{t}_{0} {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Given that it can be expressed as a multi-state model, the second line in the above equation is the **Kolmogorov's Forward Equation**:

    $$
        \text{Change} = \text{Probability IN} - \text{Probability OUT}
    $$

    For multi-decrement models, there is only a **one directional path** to each decremented state, which are always **absorbing**. Thus, the second component is always 0.

!!! Tip

    Questions may sometimes provide the forces of decrement for **each of the individual decrements** and asked to calculate the associated termination probability for each. Given the properties of the multiple decrement model, this problem can be **simplified** to avoid integrating multiple times.

    It may not always be clear on first sight, but for most euqestions, the forces of decrement can be shown to be a **fraction of the total force of mortality**:

    $$
        \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t) = c \cdot \mu^{(\tau)}_{x}
    $$

    Assuming this relationship exists, we can show that the termintation probability for a particular decrement is the **same fraction** of the total termination probability:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
        &= \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x+t} \\
        &= \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot c \cdot \mu^{(\tau)}_{x+t} \\
        &= c \cdot \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \mu^{(\tau)}_{x+t} \\
        &= c \cdot {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

Similar to the multi life section, all other results not explicitly covered above are **analagous to their single decrement counterparts**. For most items, simply add the superscript (j) to indicate that the probability is for a particular decrement.

## **Independent Rates**

In a multi-decrement setting, there are multiple decrements acting on the policyholder, which are said to be **competing with one another** to terminate the policy. The rates shown so far are known as **Dependent Rates**, which implicitly assumes that the **competition among decrements** has *already* been accounted for.

Dependent Rates should be used for projection to reflect the true underlying situation. However, decrements are often studied **independently**, resulting in **Independent Rates**:

<center>

|       Dependent Rates        |      Independent Rates      |
| :--------------------------: | :-------------------------: |
| Presence of other decrements | Absence of other decrements |
|          Competing           |        Not competing        |
|      Non-prime notation      |       Prime notation        |
|     ${}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}$      |    ${}_{t}q^{'(j)}_{x}$     |

</center>

The key is understanding the differences and how to **convert** from one form to the other.

### **Key Intuition**

Consider the following scenario:

* There are 1000 lives in the population
* The **independent** death rate is 20% ($q^{(\text{Death})}_{x}$)
* The **independent** lapse rate is 10% ($q^{(\text{Death})}_{x}$)

Consider the following outcomes:

* If death was the **only** decrement, we expect 200 people to die by the end of the year
* If lapse was the **only** decrement, we expect 100 people to lapse by the end of the year
* If **both** death and lapse are present, we would **NOT** expect 200 deaths and 100 lapses

The third point is true because:

* Someone who might have died in the later part of the year might have **already lapsed** in the earlier part
* Someone who might have lapsed in the later part of the year might have **already died** in the earlier part
* Thus, we expect fewer deaths and lapses when there are multiple decrements acting simultaneously

!!! Note

    The proper terminology to use when explaining this is that the lives are *exposed* to the force of death or lapse respectively.

The above is known as the **Theory of Competing Risk**, which leads to the following relationship:

$$
    {}_{t}q^{'(j)}_{x} \ge {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
$$

!!! Tip

    Recall that ${}_{}p^{(j)}_{x}$ was not a valid expression as it did not make sense to just survive one of the many decrements. However, under an independent rate basis, there is only ONE decrement being considered, thus ${}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x}$ is a **valid expression**.

### **Relationship**

Recall that the survival model in FAM-L is essentially a single decrement model. Thus, the key results can be applied here as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu^{(j)}_{x+t}
    &= \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{}q^{'(j)}_{x}}{{}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x}} \\
    \\
    {}_{}q^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= \int {}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x+t} \\
    &= 1 - {}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x} \\
    \\
    {}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(j)}_{x+t}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The key is understanding that the force of decrement is the **SAME** under a dependent and an independent basis. This is because the force **acts instantly** - even under a dependent basis, there is **no competition** at an instant.

!!! Warning

    This means that there is **NO such thing** as $\mu^{'(j)}_{x+t}$!

Thus, both dependent and independent rates share the **same total force of decrements and total probabilities** as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu^{(\tau)}_{x+t} &= \mu^{(1)}_{x+t} + \dots + \mu^{(m)}_{x+t}  \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    &= e^{- \int (\mu^{(1)}_{x+t} + \dots + \mu^{(m)}_{x+t})} \\
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(1)}_{x+t}} \cdot \dots \cdot e^{- \int \mu^{(m)}_{x+t}} \\
    &= {}_{}p^{'(1)}_{x+t} \cdot \dots \cdot {}_{}p^{'(m)}_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    This is conceptually identical to the probability of **independent events occuring together**:

    $$
        \text{P(A and B)} = \text{P(A)} \cdot \text{P(B)}
    $$

### **Conversion**

The key principle is to form an expression **equating the two basis together**, and solving for the missing component based on the given information:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
    \text{}
        & \text{Independent Rates}
        & \text{Dependent Rates} \\
\hline
    \text{Force}
        & \mu^{(j)}_{x} = \frac{- \frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}p^{'(j)}}{{}_{t}p^{'(j)}}
        & \mu^{(j)}_{x} = \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(j)}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}} \\
\hline
    \text{Survival}
        & {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} = \prod {}_{t}p^{'(j)}
        & {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} = 1 - {}_{t}q^{(\tau)} \\
\hline
    \text{Termination}
        & {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x} = 1 - {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}
        & {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x} = \sum {}_{t}q^{(j)} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Unless otherwise stated, the rates provided should be assumed to be **independent rates**. This is important as this concept is applicable to every other chapter in the exam.

Questions of this nature tend to involve **fractional times** (though not always). Similar to before, additional assumptions are required in order to determine the probabilities. These add **another layer of complexity** to the conversion.

#### **Constant Force**

Recall that under a constant force of mortality, the **survival probabilities** can be simplified to the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \mu^{(j)}_{x} \cdot t} \\
    \\
    {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \mu^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the force is a **constant**, we can directly **manipulate the powers** to convert from the total probability to the individual decrements:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \mu^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot t}
    \\
    \left({}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \right)^{\frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}}
    &= \left(e^{- \mu^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot t} \right)^{\frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}}
    \\
    \left({}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \right)^{\frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}}
    &= e^{- \mu^{(j)}_{x} \cdot t}
    \\
    {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= \left({}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \right)^{\frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

A more intuitive way to remember the formula would be to **remember the ratio**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= \left({}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \right)^{\frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}}
    \\
    \ln {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= {\frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \cdot \ln {}_{t}p^{'(\tau)}_{x}
    \\
    \frac{\ln {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}}{\ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}
    &= {\frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

If the ratio of the force is not available, it can be alternatively calculated via the **termination probability**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
    &= \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x+t} \\
    &= \frac{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x+t}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x+t}}
        \cdot \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x+t} \\
    &= \frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x+t}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x+t}}
        \cdot \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(\tau)}_{x+t} \\
    &= \frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x+t}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x+t}} \cdot {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x+t} \\
    \frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x+t}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x+t}}
    &= \frac{{}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    \\
    \therefore 
    \frac{\ln {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}}{\ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}
    &= {\frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}}
    = \frac{{}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

#### **Dependent UDD**

In a multi-decrement context, UDD stands for **Uniform Distribution of Decrements** (NOT death). However, because there are two sets of rates (Dependent vs Independent), there are two different UDD assumptions - based on which set is UDD.

This section assumes that the **Dependent Rates** are distributed UDD. It follows the same principles covered in FAM-L:

$$
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} = t \cdot q^{(j)}_{x}
$$

Using the above, the force of decrement can be expressed as the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} &= t \cdot q^{(j)}_{x} \\
    t \cdot q^{(j)}_{x} &= \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x+t} \\
    q^{(j)}_{x} &= {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x+t}, \ \text{Differentiation} \\
    \mu^{(j)}_{x+t} &= \frac{q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the **independent** survival probability can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(j)}_{x+t}} \\
    &= e^{- \int \frac{q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x+t}}} \\
    &= e^{-q^{(j)}_{x}} \cdot e^{\int \frac{1}{1 - t \cdot q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= e^{-q^{(j)}_{x}} \cdot e^{\frac{\ln 1 - t \cdot q^{(\tau)}_{x}}{- q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= e^{-q^{(j)}_{x}} \cdot e^{\frac{\ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}{- q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= e^{\ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)} \cdot \frac{-q^{(j)}_{x}}{-q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= \left(e^{\ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}} \right)^{\frac{q^{(j)}_{x}}{q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= \left({}_{t}p^{(\tau)} \right)^{\frac{q^{(j)}_{x}}{q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    \\
    \therefore 
    \frac{\ln {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}}{\ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}
    &= \frac{{}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}}
    = \frac{q^{(j)}_{x}}{q^{(\tau)}_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that is the exact **SAME RESULT** as the constant force scenario! Thus, it is sufficient to **remember the ratio**.

!!! Tip

    The key to the proof is understanding that the survival probability MUST be **converted into into the termination probability** (under UDD) in order to simplify the integration:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
        &= 1 - {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x} \\
        &= 1 - t \cdot q^{(\tau)}_{x}         
    \end{aligned}
    $$

#### **Independent UDD**

Conversely, this section assumes that the independent rates are distributed UDD:

$$
    {}_{t}q^{'(j)}_{x} = t \cdot q^{'(j)}_{x}
$$

Going through a **similar process** as dependent UDD, we can express the **independent** termination probability as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{'(j)}_{x} &= t \cdot q^{'(j)}_{x} \\
    t \cdot q^{'(j)}_{x} &= \int {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x+t} \\
    q^{'(j)}_{x} &= {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x+t}, \ \text{Differentiation} \\   
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the **dependent** termination probability can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
    &= \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x} \\
    &= {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x} \cdot  \int \prod_{i \ne j} {}_{t}p^{'(i)}_{x} \\
    &= q^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \int \prod_{i \ne j} {}_{t}p^{'(i)}_{x} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The final expression depends on the number of decrements in the model. The most commonly tested variation is the **two decrement model**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(1)}_{x}
    &= q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \int {}_{t}p^{'(1)}_{x} \\
    &= q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \int \left(1 - t \cdot {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} \right) \\
    &= q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \left(t - \frac{t^2}{2} {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} \right) \\
    &= t \cdot q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{t}{2} {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} \right) \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{t}q^{(2)}_{x}
    &= t \cdot q^{'(2)}_{x} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{t}{2} {}_{}q^{'(1)}_{x} \right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Assume that $t=1$,

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{t}q^{(1)}_{x} &= q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{2} {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} \right) \\
        {}_{t}q^{(2)}_{x} &= q^{'(2)}_{x} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{1}{2} {}_{}q^{'(1)}_{x} \right) \\        
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    Decrement 1 and 2 are happening **simultaneously and uniformly** throughout the year. The intuition is that, **on average**, **HALF** the population would have been decremented by lapse by before death can act on it; vice-versa.

Less commonly tested is the **Three Decrement Model**. The proof is similar to above, but much more **tedious** due to the additional product. Thus, it is recommended to memorize the result instead:

$$
    {}_{t}q^{(1)}_{x}
    = t \cdot q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{t}{2} {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} 
        - \frac{t}{2} {}_{}q^{'(3)}_{x} + \frac{t}{3} {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} {}_{}q^{'(3)}_{x} \right)
$$

### **Exact Age Decrements**

In the above UDD section, we have assumed that the decrements are acting **throughout the entire year**. However, decrements could instead occur at **exact times**, in which case **no competition** actually takes place, affecting the conversion from independent to dependent rates.

Generally speaking, there are three main scenarios to consider:

1. Occurs only at the **beginning** of the year
2. Occurs only at the **end** of the year
3. Occurs only at **some point** during the year

!!! Tip

    It is NOT recommended to memorize any of the results in this section as the the situation will change from question to question.

    It is much better to understand the principles behind the calculation so that no matter what combination is given, the probabilities can be easily calculated.

!!! Warning

    The timing of the decrements only affects the *split* between the dependent decrements. Since the underlying independent rates did not change, the **total probabilities** did not change as well.

#### **Beginning of Year**

Consider a simple model with two decrements:

* **Decrement 1**: Acts **throughout** the year
* **Decrement 2**: Acts only at the **beginning** of the year

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![BOY_Illustration](Assets/2.%20Multi%20Decrement%20Models.md/BOY_Illustration.png){.center}

The key is to understand that although decrement 1 acts throughout the year, it does **not precisely act at the beginning**, thus decrement 2 can act **without competition**. Since decrement 2 is the **first decrement without competition**, the independent and dependent rates are the same:

$$
    q^{(2)}_{x} = q^{'(2)}_{x}
$$

!!! Tip

    The key is to understand the two components that allow the relationship to be true:

    * **First Decrement**: Acts on the starting population
    * **No Competition**: No other decrements to reduce the population

    Thus, the dependent rates also act on the starting population (same as independent).

Even though decrement 1 acts without competition, the population has already been decremented by decrement 2. Thus, it acts on the **remaining population**:

$$
    q^{(1)}_{x} = q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot (1 - q^{'(2)}_{x})
$$

#### **End of Year**

Consider a simple model with two decrements:

* **Decrement 1**: Acts **throughout** the year
* **Decrement 2**: Acts only at the **end** of the year

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![EOY_Illustration](Assets/2.%20Multi%20Decrement%20Models.md/EOY_Illustration.png){.center}

Using the same logic as before, decrement 1 is the first decrement to act without competition:

$$
    q^{(1)}_{x} = q^{'(1)}_{x}
$$

!!! Warning

    Do not mistakenly assume that the above relationship only holds for exact age decrements or non-exact decrements - it can be **either of the two**.
 
Similarly, decrement 2 acts on the **remaining population**:

$$
    q^{(2)}_{x} = q^{'(2)}_{x} \cdot (1 - q^{'(1)}_{x})
$$

An **alternative method** (also applicable for BOY scenario) is to take find the other component as the balancing item (assuming it is given):

$$
    q^{(2)}_{x} = q^{(\tau)}_{x} - q^{(1)}_{x}   
$$

!!! Tip

    There is no need to memorize any of the above formulas - they are rather intuitive and can be derived on the fly.

#### **Middle of Year**

Consider a simple model with two decrements:

* **Decrement 1**: Acts **throughout** the year
* **Decrement 2**: Acts only at the **some point** during the year

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![MOY_Illustration](Assets/2.%20Multi%20Decrement%20Models.md/MOY_Illustration.png){.center}

Unlike the other two scenarios, although the decrements are acting without competition, they are not able to act on the entire starting population, thus there is **no equality** between the dependent and independent rate.

Decrement 2 occurs at some point $s$ during the year. At this point, decrement 1 has already acted for $s$ months, thus decrement 2 acts on the **remaining population**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    q^{(2)}_{x}
    &= q^{'(2)}_{x} \cdot (1 - {}_{s}q^{'(1)}_{x}) \\
    &= q^{'(2)}_{x} \cdot (1 - s \cdot q^{'(1)}_{x})  
\end{aligned}
$$

The easiest method to solve for decrement 1 is to use the complement method:

$$
    q^{(1)}_{x} = q^{(\tau)}_{x} - q^{(2)}_{x}
$$

However, it is possible to solve for the probability directly. There are **only two scenarios** that the policyholder can fail to decrement 1:

1. Policyholder fails to decrement 1 between time $0$ and $s$
2. Policyholder survives decrement 1 from till time $s$, survives all of decrement 2 but fails to decrement 1 between time $s$ to time $1$

$$
\begin{aligned}
    q^{(1)}_{x}
    &= \text{P(Scenario 1)} + \text{P(Scenario 2)} \\
    &= {}_{s}q^{'(1)}_{x} + {}_{s}p^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot p^{'(2)}_{x} \cdot {}_{1-s}q^{'(1)}_{x+s} \\
    &= s \cdot q^{'(1)}_{x}
    + {}_{s}p^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot p^{'(2)}_{x} \cdot \frac{(1-s) \cdot q^{'(1)}_{x}}{{}_{s}p^{'(1)}_{x}} \\
    &= s \cdot q^{'(1)}_{x} + \cdot p^{'(2)}_{x} \cdot (1-s) q^{'(1)}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to apply the UDD assumption directly to the above equation:

    $$
        {}_{1-s}q^{'(1)}_{x+s} \ne (1-s) q^{'(1)}_{x}
    $$

    This is because the UDD assumption is only applicable to an individual who is **alive at the start of the year**. Thus, only when survival probability is accounted for can it be used:

    $$
        {}_{s}p^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot {}_{1-s}q^{'(1)}_{x+s} = (1-s) q^{'(1)}_{x}
    $$

    This can be proven via conditional probability:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{s}p^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot {}_{1-s}q^{'(1)}_{x+s}
        &= \text{P(Fail from s to 1 | Survive to s)} \\
        &= \frac{\text{P(Fail from s to 1 and survive to s)}}{\text{P(Survive to s)}} \\
        &= \frac{q^{'(1)}_{x} - {}_{s}q^{'(1)}_{x}}{{}_{s}p^{'(1)}_{x}} \\
        &= \frac{q^{'(1)}_{x} - s \cdot q^{'(1)}_{x}}{{}_{s}p^{'(1)}_{x}} \\
        &= \frac{(1-s) \cdot q^{'(1)}_{x}}{{}_{s}p^{'(1)}_{x}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

    q^{(3)}_{x} &= (1 - q^{'(1)}_{x}) \cdot (1 - q^{'(2)}_{x}) \cdot q^{'(3)}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    The most important thing to remember is that all the above equations are attempting to calculate **dependent rates from independent ones**.

## **Insurance Applications**

Multi-decrement assurances and annuities are concpetually similar to their single decrement counterparts - Equivalence Principle, Approximation etc.

The key difference is that the benefit is the combination of **multiple benefits**, typically for **each decrement** in the model:

$$
    \text{EPV Benefit} = \text{EPV Benefit 1} + \text{EPV Benefit 2} + \dots
$$

!!! Warning

    Not all benefits may be a lump sum payment. It is possible to receive an **annuity as a benefit** (EG. Receiving 5 years of payments upon diagnosis of a disability).

    $$
        \text{"Annuity" Benefit} = \text{PV (Payments)}
    $$

### **Random Variable**

Recall that in FAM-L, we derived the EPV of the contract using a bottom’s up approach with the **Random Variable denoting the PV of the benefits**.

For a multi-decrement policy, there are different benefits for each decrement. Thus, the random variable is expressed as a **Piecewise Function** for each decrement:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    Z
    &=
    \begin{cases}
        B_{1} \cdot v^{k+1}, & {}_{k \mid}q^{(1)}_{x} \\
        B_{2} \cdot v^{k+1}, & {}_{k \mid}q^{(2)}_{x}
    \end{cases}
\end{aligned}
$$

Using this, we can derive an expression for the EPV of the policy:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV}
    &= E(Z) \\
    &= \sum B_{1} v^{k+1} \cdot {}_{k \mid}q^{(1)}_{x} + \sum B_{2} v^{k+1} \cdot {}_{k \mid}q^{(2)}_{x} \\
    &= \sum B_{1} v^{k+1} \cdot {}_{k}p^{(\tau)}_{x} q^{(1)}_{x+k}
    +  \sum B_{2} v^{k+1} \cdot {}_{k}p^{(\tau)}_{x} q^{(2)}_{x+k}
\end{aligned}
$$

The key difference is how the **Variance** is calculated. Since there are now two different benefits, there is a **correlation term** that must be handled:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    E(Z^{2})
    &= \sum \left(B_{1} \cdot v^{k+1} \right)^{2} \cdot {}_{k \mid}q^{(1)}_{x}
    + \sum \left(B_{2} \cdot v^{k+1} \right)^{2} \cdot {}_{k \mid}q^{(2)}_{x}
    \\
    [E(Z)]^{2}
    &= \left (\sum B_{1} v^{k+1} \cdot {}_{k}p^{(\tau)}_{x} q^{(1)}_{x+k} \right)^{2} \\
    &+ \left (\sum B_{2} v^{k+1} \cdot {}_{k}p^{(\tau)}_{x} q^{(2)}_{x+k} \right)^{2} \\
    &+ 2 \cdot \left (\sum B_{2} v^{k+1} \cdot {}_{k}p^{(\tau)}_{x} q^{(2)}_{x+k} \right)
    \cdot \left(\sum B_{2} v^{k+1} \cdot {}_{k}p^{(\tau)}_{x} q^{(2)}_{x+k} \right)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    The notation for these type of questions are extremely heavy, there is a high tendency to make mistakes as a result.

### **Surrender Benefit**

The most common additional benefit is the **Surrender Benefit**. In practice, virtually all whole life insurance policies offer a surrender benefit of the policy. It is also known as the **cash value** of the policy.

However, surrender benefits are **not typically offered** for annuities. This is to avoid **Adverse Selection**:

* Goal of risk pooling annuities is to use the **excess funds from those who die early** to fund those who live longer
* This is why annuities are often **offerred without underwriting**; it is in the insurer's favour if someone of poor health joins the pool
* However, if a surrender benefit is offered, those in poor health will be incentivized to surrender, leaving the pool with **only healthy individuals** who tend to live long lives

!!! Tip

    Some questions may not directly call it a surrender benefit. It could be phrased as a **conversion** from this policy type to another.

    Conversions usually occur in the following mechanism - the existing policy is **surrendered for its cash value**, and used to purchase a new single premium policy of the new type.

!!! Note

    This is the **opposite of insurance**, where the goal of the risk pool is to use the **excess funds from those live longer** fund those who die younger. Thus, the insurer only wants those in relatively good health to join the pool, which is why there is a **rigorous underwriting process**.

Adverse Selection will result in **actual experience being far worse** than what was assumed during pricing, which would lead to the policies being under-reserved, which could threaten the solvency of the insurer. Thus, there are two approaches to deal with this:

* Preventive measures to avoid adverse selection (Usual approach)
* Account for adverse selection during pricing stage

!!! Note

    Adverse Selection is a situation where the policyholder has more information about their risk compared to the insurer (Asymmetric Information).

    The policyholder will then choose the option that is most beneficial to them - choosing high insurance coverage or in the above case, surrendering an annuity for cash value (if possible).
