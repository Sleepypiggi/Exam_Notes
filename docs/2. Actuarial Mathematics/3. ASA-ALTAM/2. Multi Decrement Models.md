# **Multiple Decrement Model**

## **Overview**

In FAM-L, we only considered simple insurance policies which paid **only** a death benefit. In reality, insurance contracts often pay **one of a few** possible benefits:

<center>

|         Benefit          |          Trigger          |
| :----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
|      Death Benefit       |  Death by natural causes  |
| Accidental Death Benefit |     Death by accident     |
|    Surrender Benefit     |    Lapsing the policy     |
|  Dread Disease Benefit   | Contracting Dread Disease |

</center>

!!! Warning

    For the purposes of this exam, it is assumed that these type of policies only pay ONE of the benefits.

    In other words, making a claim on either of the benefits will trigger a claim and then **terminate the policy**.

The different benefit triggers are **different ways that the policy can terminate**, known as a **Decrement**.

!!! Info

    The definition of a Decrement is "to decrease". In the context of life insurance, it decreases the number of active policies.

Thus, the simple policy considered in FAM-L is an example of a **Single Decrement Model** while the policy described above is an example of a **Multiple Decrement Model**.


## **Probability**

Previously, since death was the only decrement, we only considered the probability of death. However, in a multiple decrement setting, we more generally consider the **probability of termination**.

The multiple decrement model has two components:

* **Discrete Random Variable $J$** - Denoting the decrements in the model
* **Continuous Random Variable $T$** - Denoting the time to termintaton based on that decrement

Combining the two, the probability of termination in $t$ years due to a **particular decrement** $j$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
    &= P(T_{x} \lt t, J_{x} = j) \\
    &= \int^{t}_{0} f_{T_{x}, J_{x}}(t, j)
\end{aligned}
$$

The probability of termination due to **any possible cause** in $t$ years is the sum of all individual probabilities of all $m$ decrements:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= {}_{t}q^{(1)}_{x} + {}_{t}q^{(2)}_{x} + \dots + {}_{t}q^{(m)}_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{j=m}_{j=1} {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    $\tau$ is the notation used the denote all possible decrements.

Thus, the probability of surviving $t$ years is denoted as:

$$
    {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} = 1 - {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}
$$

!!! Warning

    There is NO such thing as ${}_{t}p^{(j)}_{x}$!

    The above would be the probability of surviving $t$ years from decrement $j$. However, even if they do not terminate from decrement $j$, they **can still terminate from other causes**.

    Ultimately, we are **only concerned whether the individual is still alive at time $t$**, not whether or not they survive a particular decrement.

The **force of decrement** has similar properties as the termination probability:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t)
    &= \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    \\
    \mu^{(\tau)}_{x}(t)
    &= \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{1}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}
       \left (\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} \right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}
       \frac{d}{dt} \left[{}_{t}q^{(1)}_{x} + \dots {}_{t}q^{(m)}_{x} \right] \\
    &= \mu^{(1)}_{x} + \dots + \mu^{(m)}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    This allows us to express the *total* survival probability as:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
        &= e^{- \int \mu^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
        &= e^{- \int (\mu^{(1)}_{x} + \dots + \mu^{(m)}_{x})} \\        
    \end{aligned}
    $$

Thus, the PDF of the joint distribution can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    f_{T_{x}, J_{x}}(t, j)
    &= {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t) \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
    &= \int^{t}_{0} {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t)
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Questions may sometimes provide the forces of mortality for **each of the individual decrements** and asked to calculate the associated termination probability for each.

    Given the properties of the multiple decrement model, this problem can be simplified to avoid integrating multiple times.

    For most questions, the forces of mortality can be shown to be a **fraction of the total force of mortality**:

    $$
        \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t) = c \cdot \mu^{(\tau)}_{x}
    $$

    It may not always be clear on first sight as some forces of mortality have algebraic expressions, but they tend to **cancel out**.

    Assuming this relationship exists, we can show that the termintation probability for a particular decrement is the same fraction of the total termination probability:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
        &= \int {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t) \\
        &= \int {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} \cdot c \cdot \mu^{(\tau)}_{x}(t) \\
        &= c \cdot \int {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} \mu^{(\tau)}_{x}(t) \\
        &= c \cdot {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

Similar to the multi life section, all other results not explicitly covered above are **analagous to their single decrement counterparts**. For most items, simply add the superscript (j) to indicate that the probability is for a particular decrement.

!!! WARNING

    TO CHECK ON DEFERRED

## **Competing Risks**

The policy can only terminate from ONE of the decrements in the policy. Each decrement is **competing with one another** to terminate the policy.

Thus, we can consider two sets of rates:

<center>

|   Dependent Rates   |    Independent Rates    |
| :-----------------: | :---------------------: |
| Considered together | Considered in isolation |
|      Competing      |      Not competing      |
| ${}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}$ |  ${}_{t}q^{'(j)}_{x}$   |

</center>

Ultimately, only the **dependent rates** will be used for policy calculations. However, decrements are often studied in isolation, providing us with the **independent rates**. Thus, it is important to know how to convert one set of rates to another.

!!! Note

    Most real world cases involve converting independent rates to dependent ones. However, for the purposes of this exam, it is often to know how to convert BOTH ways, as the question could ask for either.

### **Independent Rates**

The key difference between dependent and independent rates is in the treatment of the **survival probability**.

Under independent rates, ${}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x}$ is a **VALID** expression. This is because only decrement $j$ is being considered, thus surviving decrement $j$ is essentially surviving from all decrements.

The probability results are thus analagous to the dependent case:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu^{(j)}_{x}
    &= \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{}q^{'(j)}_{x}}{{}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x}} \\
    \\
    {}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(j)}_{x}} \\
    \\
    {}_{}q^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= \int {}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x} \\
    &= 1 - {}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    This is the SAME force of decrement as the dependent case. TBC on the reason why.

Using the above expression, we can form a relationship with the dependent survival probability:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    &= e^{- \int (\mu^{(1)}_{x} + \dots + \mu^{(m)}_{x})} \\
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(1)}_{x}} \cdot \dots \cdot e^{- \int \mu^{(m)}_{x}} \\
    &= {}_{}p^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \dots \cdot {}_{}p^{'(m)}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Intuitively, the probability of surviving is the probability that the policyholder survives decrement 1 AND decrement 2 AND ... AND decrement $m$.

Since each individual probability must be $\le 1$, we can show that:

$$
    {}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x} \ge {}_{}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
$$

Given the above relationship, we can show a similar comparison for the termination probability:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{}q^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= \int {}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x} \\
    \\
    {}_{}q^{(j)}_{x}
    &= \int {}_{}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x} \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{}q^{'(j)}_{x} \ge {}_{}q^{(j)}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

The above lead to the following intuitions:

* In isolation, the probability of surviving is higher because there are **fewer decrements to terminate it**
* In isolation, the probability of terminating from a specific decrement is higher because there are **no other decrements to compete** with it

### **Algebraic Conversion**

The first type of conversion involves converting **algebraic expressions** of the dependent and independent probabilities to the other. This should be **less common** on the exam.

The key is to understand that the **force of decrement is shared** between the Dependent and Independent probabilities.

Using the respective probabilities method of determining the force, calculate the other's probability via integration:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
    \text{}
        & \text{Independent to Dependent}
        & \text{Dependent to Independent} \\
\hline
    \text{Given Prob}
        & {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} = \prod {}_{t}p^{'(j)}
        & {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x} = \sum {}_{t}q^{(j)} \\
\hline
    \text{Calc Force}
        & \mu^{(j)}_{x} = \frac{- \frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}p^{'(j)}}{{}_{t}p^{'(j)}}
        & \mu^{(j)}_{x} = \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(j)}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}} \\
\hline
    \text{Target Prob}
        & {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} = \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}
        & {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x} = e^{- \int \mu^{(j)}_{x}} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

### **Value Conversion**

The other type of conversion involves converting **actual values** of the dependent and independent probabilities to the other. This should be **more common** on the exam.

Questions of this nature tend to involve **fractional times**. Thus, for this section, we assume that $t \le 1$.

Similar to before, we will require several assumptions about the decrements to calculate the probabilities.

#### **Constant Force**

Under a constant force of mortality, the two survival probabilities can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(j)}_{x}} \\
    &= e^{- t \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}} \\
    \\
    {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    &= e^{- t \cdot \mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Since the forces are constant, we can raise the power of the probabilities to force them to be the same:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= e^{- t \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}} \\
    ({}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x})^{\frac{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}}
    &= (e^{- t \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}})^{\frac{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}} \\
    {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= ({}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x})^{\frac{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

If the forces themselves are not directly available, the **termination probability** can be used to achieve the same ratio:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
    &= \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x} \\
    &= \frac{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}
        \cdot \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x} \\
    &= \frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}
        \cdot \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(\tau)}_{x} \\
    &= \frac{\mu^{(j)_{x}}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}} \cdot {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x} \\
    \frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}
    &= \frac{{}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= ({}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x})^{\frac{{}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}}{{}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

With a bit of algebra, we can find a **direct formula** for the termination probability:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= ({}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x})^{\frac{{}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    \ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= \frac{{}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}}
        \cdot \ln {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x} \\
    \therefore {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
    &= {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}
        \cdot \frac{\ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}{\ln {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

It is NOT recommended to memorize this formula. It is much easier to derive it on the spot.

#### **Multi UDD**

Multi UDD means that the **dependent decrements** are assumed to be UDD.

!!! Note

    In this context, UDD is known as **Uniform Distribution of Decrements**, which follows the same principles as UDD covered in FAM-L context.

Using MUDD, the force of decrement can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} &= t \cdot q^{(j)}_{x} \\
    t \cdot q^{(j)}_{x} &= \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t) \\
    q^{(j)}_{x} &= {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t), \ \text{Differentiation} \\
    \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t) &= \frac{q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the survival probability can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(j)}_{x}} \\
    &= e^{- \int \frac{q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= e^{-q^{(j)}_{x}} \cdot e^{\int \frac{1}{1 - t \cdot q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= e^{-q^{(j)}_{x}} \cdot e^{\frac{\ln 1 - t \cdot q^{(\tau)}_{x}}{- q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= e^{-q^{(j)}_{x}} \cdot e^{\frac{\ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}{- q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= e^{\ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)} \cdot \frac{-q^{(j)}_{x}}{-q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= \left(e^{\ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}} \right)^{\frac{q^{(j)}_{x}}{q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= ({}_{t}p^{(\tau)})^{\frac{q^{(j)}_{x}}{q^{(\tau)}_{x}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that is the exact **SAME RESULT** as the constant force scenario! The only difference is that the exponent MUST be the ratio of the termination probabilities, NOT the forces of decrements.

!!! Tip

    The key to the proof is understanding that the survival probability MUST be **converted into into the termination probability** (under UDD) in order to simplify the integration:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
        &= 1 - {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x} \\
        &= 1 - t \cdot q^{(\tau)}_{x}         
    \end{aligned}
    $$

#### **Single UDD**

Single UDD means that the **INDEPENDENT decrements** are assumed to be UDD.

SUDD leads to a similar starting result as MUDD:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{'(j)}_{x} &= t \cdot q^{'(j)}_{x} \\
    t \cdot q^{'(j)}_{x} &= \int {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t) \\
    q^{'(j)}_{x} &= {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t), \ \text{Differentiation} \\   
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the above, the termination probability can be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
    &= \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x} \\
    &= {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x} \cdot  \int \prod_{i \ne j} {}_{t}p^{'(i)}_{x} \\
    &= q^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \int \prod_{i \ne j} {}_{t}p^{'(i)}_{x} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The final expression depends on the number of decrements in the model. The most commonly tested variation is the **two decrement model**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(1)}_{x}
    &= q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \int {}_{t}p^{'(1)}_{x} \\
    &= q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \int \left(1 - t \cdot {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} \right) \\
    &= q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \left(t - \frac{t^2}{2} {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} \right) \\
    &= t \cdot q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{t}{2} {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} \right) \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{t}q^{(2)}_{x}
    &= t \cdot q^{'(2)}_{x} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{t}{2} {}_{}q^{'(1)}_{x} \right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Less commonly tested is the **Three Decrement Model**. The proof is similar to above, but much more **tedious** due to the additional product. Thus, it is recommended to memorize the result instead:

$$
    {}_{t}q^{(1)}_{x}
    = t \cdot q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{t}{2} {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} 
        - \frac{t}{2} {}_{}q^{'(3)}_{x} + \frac{t}{3} {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} {}_{}q^{'(3)}_{x} \right)
$$

## **Decrement Combination**

A commonly asked question in the exam is to find the probabilities of termination, given that **different types** of decrements are present in the model.

These types of questions often involve **one or more of the following aspects** which make them complicated:

* Continuous and discrete decrements mixed together
* Continuous decrements competing with each other
* Discrete decrements occuring at fractional ages within the year

### **Life Table Method**

Similar to FAM-L, a good way of simplifying the problem is to create our own **life tables**.

In a multi-decrement setting, $\ell^{(\tau)}_{x}$ represents the **total population** at the beginning while ${}_{t}d^{(j)}_{x}$ represents the terminations due to a **specific decrement** within $t$ years.

Thus, the probability of termination or survival can be calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
   {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} &= \frac{{}_{t}d^{(j)}_{x}}{\ell^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
   {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} &= \frac{\ell^{(\tau)}_{x+t}}{\ell^{(\tau)}_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Technically speaking, all calculations in this section can be solved directly using probability formulas. However, it is much easier and intuitive to use the life table method instead.

### **Ultimate Model**

Consider a model with **four decrements**:

1. Discrete (Acts at the **beginning of year** only)
2. Continuous (Acts throughout the year)
3. Continuous (Acts throughout the year)
4. Discrete (Acts at the **end of year** only)

Decrements 2 and 3 are competing with each other as they are occuring at the same time. Although they act *throughout* the year, they do NOT compete with the discrete decrements that act at a single time point.

!!! Note

    This is similar to the concept of a continuous random variable - they are not defined at a single time point.

<!-- Self Made -->
![Ultimate Model](Assets/2.%20Multi%20Decrement%20Models.md/Ultimate%20Model.png){.center}

Firstly, at the **beginning of the year**:

* Decrement 1 acts **alone**
* Since no other decrement has acted, the **original population** is used as the base

$$
    d^{(1)}_{x} = \ell^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot q^{(1)}_{x}
$$

!!! Note

    Since decrement 1 is acting alone with no competition, there is **NO difference** between the dependent and independent probabilities:

    $$
        q^{(1)}_{x} = q^{'(1)}_{x}
    $$

Secondly, **throughout the year**:

* Decrement 2 and 3 **competes with each other** (Dependent probabilities must be used)
* Since **decrement 1 has acted**, the population must be adjusted accordingly

Using whatever assumption was given, calculate the dependent probabilities for each decrement. Thus, calculate the number of terminations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    d^{(2)}_{x} &= (\ell^{(\tau)}_{x} - d^{(1)}_{x}) \cdot q^{(2)}_{x} \\
    d^{(3)}_{x} &= (\ell^{(\tau)}_{x} - d^{(1)}_{x}) \cdot q^{(2)}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The same base is used for BOTH decrements. This is because we have **already accounted for interaction** between the two via the dependent probabilities.

Lastly, **at the end of the year**:

* Decrement 4 acts **alone**
* Since **all other decrements have acted**, the population must be adjusted accordingly

$$
    d^{(4)}_{x} = (\ell^{(\tau)}_{x} - d^{(1)}_{x} - d^{(2)}_{x} - d^{(3)}_{x}) \cdot q^{(4)}_{x}
$$

!!! Note

    Similar to decrement 1, there is no difference between the dependent and independent probabilities in this case.

Using the above components, the respective probabilities of termination or survival can be calculated.

!!! Tip

    It is NOT recommended to memorize any of the results in this section as the the situation will change from question to question.

    It is much better to understand the principles behind the calculation so that no matter what combination is given, the probabilities can be easily calculated.

### **Fractional Age**

Consider a two decrement model:

1. Discrete (Acts at the end of the first quarter)
2. Continuous (Acts throughout the year)

<!-- Self Made -->
![Fractional Model](Assets/2.%20Multi%20Decrement%20Models.md/Fractional%20Model.png){.center}

Firstly, **during the first quarter**:

* Decrement 2 acts alone
* Since no other decrement has acted, the original population is used

Assuming that **decrement 2 is UDD**,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{0.25}q^{(2)}_{x} &= 0.25 \cdot q^{(2)}_{x} \\
    \therefore {}_{0.25}d^{(2)}_{x} &= \ell^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot 0.25 \cdot q^{(2)}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Secondly, at the **end of the first quarter**:

* Decrement 1 acts alone
* Since no other decrement 1 has acted, the population must be adjusted accordingly

$$
    d^{(1)}_{x} = (\ell^{(\tau)}_{x} - {}_{0.25}d^{(2)}_{x}) \cdot q^{(1)}_{x}
$$

Lastly, for the remaining of the year:

* Decrement 1 acts alone
* Since decrement 1 has acted, the population must be adjusted accordingly

This is **complicated**, as the probability that must be used at this point is a fractional probability:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{0.75}q^{(2)}_{x+0.25}
    &= \frac{{}_{0.75}d^{(2)}_{x+0.25}}{\ell^{(2)}_{x+0.25}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell^{(2)}_{x+0.25} - \ell^{(2)}_{x+0.25}}{\ell^{(2)}_{x+0.25}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell^{(2)}_{x} - 0.25 \cdot d^{(2)}_{x} - (\ell^{(2)}_{x} - d^{(2)}_{x})}
            {\ell^{(2)}_{x} - {}_{0.25}d^{(2)}_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{0.75 d^{(2)}_{x}}{\ell^{(2)}_{x} - {}_{0.25}d^{(2)}_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Although the above probability can be solved using first principles as shown above, the intuition is simple - the **proportion of people** that die in the remaining quarters of the year must remain the same.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{0.75}d^{(2)}_{x+0.25}
    &= (\ell^{(\tau)}_{x} - {}_{0.25}d^{(2)}_{x} - d^{(1)}_{x}) \cdot {}_{0.75}q^{(2)}_{x+0.25} \\
    \\
    \therefore d^{(2)}_{x} &= {}_{0.25}d^{(2)}_{x} + {}_{0.75}d^{(2)}_{x+0.25}

## **Insurance Applications**

Multi-decrement assurances and annuities are concpetually similar to their single decrement counterparts - Equivalence Principle, Continuous Discrete Approximation etc.

The key difference is that the benefit is the combination of **multiple benefits**, typically for **each decrement** in the model:

$$
    \text{EPV Benefit} = \text{EPV Benefit 1} + \text{EPV Benefit 2} + \dots
$$

All other calculations remain the same as before.
