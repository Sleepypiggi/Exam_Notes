# **Multiple Decrement Model**

## **Overview**

In FAM-L, we only considered simple insurance policies which paid **only** a death benefit. In reality, insurance contracts often pay **one of a few** possible benefits:

<center>

|         Benefit          |          Trigger          |
| :----------------------: | :-----------------------: |
|      Death Benefit       |  Death by natural causes  |
| Accidental Death Benefit |     Death by accident     |
|    Surrender Benefit     |    Lapsing the policy     |
|  Dread Disease Benefit   | Contracting Dread Disease |

</center>

!!! Note

    Functionally, multi-decrement models can be understood as a **one to many multi-state model**.

    For the purposes of this exam, unless otherwise stated, it is assumed that these type of policies only pay ONE of the benefits. Making a claim on either of the benefits will trigger a claim and then **terminate the policy**.

The different benefit triggers are **different ways that the policy can terminate**, known as a **Decrement**. Thus, the simple policy considered in FAM-L is an example of a **Single Decrement Model** while the policy described above is an example of a **Multiple Decrement Model**.

!!! Info

    The definition of a Decrement is "to decrease". In the context of life insurance, it decreases the number of active policies.

## **Probability**

Previously, since death was the only decrement, we only considered the probability of death. However, in a multiple decrement setting, we more generally consider the **probability of termination**.

The multiple decrement model has two components:

* **Discrete Random Variable $J$** - Denoting the decrements in the model
* **Continuous Random Variable $T$** - Denoting the time to termintaton based on that decrement

Combining the two, the probability of termination in $t$ years due to a **particular decrement** $j$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
    &= P(T_{x} \lt t, J_{x} = j) \\
    &= \int^{t}_{0} f_{T_{x}, J_{x}}(t, j)
\end{aligned}
$$

The probability of termination due to **any possible cause** in $t$ years is the sum of all individual probabilities of all $m$ decrements:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= {}_{t}q^{(1)}_{x} + {}_{t}q^{(2)}_{x} + \dots + {}_{t}q^{(m)}_{x} \\
    &= \sum^{j=m}_{j=1} {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    $\tau$ is the notation used the denote **ALL** possible decrements.

    The above is valid because we assumed that the policyholder can only terminate from ONE of the decrements. Thus, each decrement is **mutually exclusive**, where the probability of termination from any cause is the sum of each individual probability (OR logic).

Thus, the probability of surviving $t$ years is denoted as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= 1 - {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x} \\
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(\tau)}_{x+t}} 
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    There is NO such thing as ${}_{t}p^{(j)}_{x}$!

    The above would be the probability of surviving $t$ years from decrement $j$. However, even if they do not terminate from decrement $j$, they **can still terminate from OTHER decrements**.

    Ultimately, we are **only concerned whether the individual is still alive at time $t$**, not whether or not they survive a *particular* decrement.

The **force of decrement** has similar properties as the termination probability:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t)
    &= \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    \\
    \mu^{(\tau)}_{x}(t)
    &= \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{1}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}
       \left (\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x} \right) \\
    &= \frac{1}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}
       \frac{d}{dt} \left[{}_{t}q^{(1)}_{x} + \dots {}_{t}q^{(m)}_{x} \right] \\
    &= \mu^{(1)}_{x+t} + \dots + \mu^{(m)}_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the PDF of the joint distribution can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t) &= \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    \frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} &= {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot  \mu^{(j)}_{x+t} \\
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} &= \int^{t}_{0} {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Given that it can be expressed as a multi-state model, the second line in the above equation is the **Kolmogorov's Forward Equation**:

    $$
        \text{Change} = \text{Probability IN} - \text{Probability OUT}
    $$

    For multi-decrement models, there is only a **one directional path** to each decremented state, which are always **absorbing**. Thus, the second component is always 0.

!!! Tip

    Questions may sometimes provide the forces of decrement for **each of the individual decrements** and asked to calculate the associated termination probability for each. Given the properties of the multiple decrement model, this problem can be **simplified** to avoid integrating multiple times.

    It may not always be clear on first sight, but for most euqestions, the forces of decrement can be shown to be a **fraction of the total force of mortality**:

    $$
        \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t) = c \cdot \mu^{(\tau)}_{x}
    $$

    Assuming this relationship exists, we can show that the termintation probability for a particular decrement is the same fraction of the total termination probability:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
        &= \int {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x+t} \\
        &= \int {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} \cdot c \cdot \mu^{(\tau)}_{x+t} \\
        &= c \cdot \int {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} \mu^{(\tau)}_{x+t} \\
        &= c \cdot {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

Similar to the multi life section, all other results not explicitly covered above are **analagous to their single decrement counterparts**. For most items, simply add the superscript (j) to indicate that the probability is for a particular decrement.

## **Independent Rates**

In a multi-decrement setting, there are multiple decrements acting on the policyholder, which are said to be **competing with one another** to terminate the policy. The rates shown so far are known as **Dependent Rates**, which implicitly assumes that the **competition among decrements** has been accounted for.

Dependent Rates should be used for projection to reflect the true underlying situation. However, decrements are often studied **independently**, resulting in **Independent Rates**:

<center>

|   Dependent Rates   |    Independent Rates    |
| :-----------------: | :---------------------: |
| Considered together | Considered in isolation |
|      Competing      |      Not competing      |
| Non-prime notation  |     Prime notation      |
| ${}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}$ |  ${}_{t}q^{'(j)}_{x}$   |

</center>

<!-- Self Made, to insert diagram -->

The key is understanding the differences and how to **convert** from one form to the other.

### **Key Intuition**

The key is understanding that only **one decrement is accounted for** in an independent rate world. Consider the following example:

* There are 10 planes; each plane carries 100 people
* On a particular plane, 6 people died from food poisoning
* That plane then crashes, the remaining 94 people died

Under an independent rate basis, it **does not capture the nuance that** termination could be due to other decrements:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(\text{Plane Crash})}_{x} &= \frac{94}{100} \\
    {}_{t}q^{'(\text{Plane Crash})}_{x} &= \frac{100}{1000} \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{t}q^{'(j)}_{x} &\ge {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Recall that ${}_{}p^{(j)}_{x}$ was not a valid expression as it did not make sense to just survive one of the many decrements. However, under an independent rate basis, there is only ONE decrement being considered, thus ${}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x}$ is a **valid expression**.

### **Relationship**

Recall that the survival model in FAM-L is essentially a single decrement model. Thus, the key results can be applied here as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu^{(j)}_{x+t}
    &= \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{}q^{'(j)}_{x}}{{}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x}} \\
    \\
    {}_{}q^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= \int {}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x+t} \\
    &= 1 - {}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x} \\
    \\
    {}_{}p^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(j)}_{x+t}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The key is understanding that the force of decrement is the **SAME** under a dependent and an independent basis. This is because the force **acts instantly** - even under a dependent basis, there is **no competition** at an instant.

!!! Warning

    This means that there is **NO such thing** as $\mu^{'(j)}_{x+t}$!

Thus, both dependent and independent rates share the **same total force of decrements and total probabilities** as well:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \mu^{(\tau)}_{x+t} &= \mu^{(1)}_{x+t} + \dots + \mu^{(m)}_{x+t}  \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    &= e^{- \int (\mu^{(1)}_{x+t} + \dots + \mu^{(m)}_{x+t})} \\
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(1)}_{x+t}} \cdot \dots \cdot e^{- \int \mu^{(m)}_{x+t}} \\
    &= {}_{}p^{'(1)}_{x+t} \cdot \dots \cdot {}_{}p^{'(m)}_{x+t}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    This is conceptually identical to the probability of **independent events occuring together**:

    $$
        \text{P(A and B)} = \text{P(A)} \cdot \text{P(B)}
    $$

### **Conversion**

The key principle is to form an expression **equating the two basis together**, and solving for the missing component based on the given information:

$$
\begin{array}{|c|c|c|}
\hline
    \text{}
        & \text{Independent Rates}
        & \text{Dependent Rates} \\
\hline
    \text{Force}
        & \mu^{(j)}_{x} = \frac{- \frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}p^{'(j)}}{{}_{t}p^{'(j)}}
        & \mu^{(j)}_{x} = \frac{\frac{d}{dt} {}_{t}q^{(j)}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}} \\
\hline
    \text{Survival}
        & {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} = \prod {}_{t}p^{'(j)}
        & {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} = 1 - {}_{t}q^{(\tau)} \\
\hline
    \text{Termination}
        & {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x} = 1 - {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}
        & {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x} = \sum {}_{t}q^{(j)} \\
\hline
\end{array}
$$

Questions of this nature tend to involve **fractional times** (though not always). Similar to before, additional assumptions are required in order to determine the probabilities. These add **another layer of complexity** to the conversion.

#### **Constant Force**

Recall that under a constant force of mortality, the **survival probabilities** can be simplified to the following:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \mu^{(j)}_{x} \cdot t} \\
    \\
    {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \mu^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot t}
\end{aligned}
$$

Fundamentally, the approach remains unchanged. We want to equate the two basis together using one of the shared components, then solve for the desired basis.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= e^{- t \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}}
    \\
    ({}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x})^{\frac{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}}
    &= (e^{- t \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}})^{\frac{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}}
    \\
    ({}_{t}p^{‘(j)}_{x})^{\frac{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}}
    
    {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= ({}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x})^{\frac{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

x -> Tau -> x

!!! Tip

    Under a constant force, the survival probability is simplified and thus will be the focus of the approach. The key is understanding that since the force is constant, it can be **manipulated to obtain equality** 


If the forces themselves are not directly available, the **termination probability** can be used to achieve the same ratio:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
    &= \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x} \\
    &= \frac{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}
        \cdot \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x} \\
    &= \frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}
        \cdot \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(\tau)}_{x} \\
    &= \frac{\mu^{(j)_{x}}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}} \cdot {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x} \\
    \frac{\mu^{(j)}_{x}}{\mu^{(\tau)}_{x}}
    &= \frac{{}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= ({}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x})^{\frac{{}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}}{{}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

With a bit of algebra, we can find a **direct formula** for the termination probability:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= ({}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x})^{\frac{{}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    \ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
    &= \frac{{}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}}
        \cdot \ln {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x} \\
    \therefore {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
    &= {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x}
        \cdot \frac{\ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}{\ln {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

It is NOT recommended to memorize this formula. It is much easier to derive it on the spot.

#### **Multi UDD**

Multi UDD means that the **dependent decrements** are assumed to be UDD.

!!! Note

    In this context, UDD is known as **Uniform Distribution of Decrements**, which follows the same principles as UDD covered in FAM-L context.

Using MUDD, the force of decrement can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} &= t \cdot q^{(j)}_{x} \\
    t \cdot q^{(j)}_{x} &= \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t) \\
    q^{(j)}_{x} &= {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t), \ \text{Differentiation} \\
    \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t) &= \frac{q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the survival probability can be expressed as:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x}
    &= e^{- \int \mu^{(j)}_{x}} \\
    &= e^{- \int \frac{q^{(j)}_{x}}{{}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= e^{-q^{(j)}_{x}} \cdot e^{\int \frac{1}{1 - t \cdot q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= e^{-q^{(j)}_{x}} \cdot e^{\frac{\ln 1 - t \cdot q^{(\tau)}_{x}}{- q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= e^{-q^{(j)}_{x}} \cdot e^{\frac{\ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}}{- q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= e^{\ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)} \cdot \frac{-q^{(j)}_{x}}{-q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= \left(e^{\ln {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}} \right)^{\frac{q^{(j)}_{x}}{q^{(\tau)}_{x}}} \\
    &= ({}_{t}p^{(\tau)})^{\frac{q^{(j)}_{x}}{q^{(\tau)}_{x}}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Notice that is the exact **SAME RESULT** as the constant force scenario! The only difference is that the exponent MUST be the ratio of the termination probabilities, NOT the forces of decrements.

!!! Tip

    The key to the proof is understanding that the survival probability MUST be **converted into into the termination probability** (under UDD) in order to simplify the integration:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x}
        &= 1 - {}_{t}q^{(\tau)}_{x} \\
        &= 1 - t \cdot q^{(\tau)}_{x}         
    \end{aligned}
    $$

#### **Single UDD**

Single UDD means that the **INDEPENDENT decrements** are assumed to be UDD.

SUDD leads to a similar starting result as MUDD:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{'(j)}_{x} &= t \cdot q^{'(j)}_{x} \\
    t \cdot q^{'(j)}_{x} &= \int {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t) \\
    q^{'(j)}_{x} &= {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x}(t), \ \text{Differentiation} \\   
\end{aligned}
$$

Using the above, the termination probability can be calculated:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x}
    &= \int {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x} \\
    &= {}_{t}p^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \mu^{(j)}_{x} \cdot  \int \prod_{i \ne j} {}_{t}p^{'(i)}_{x} \\
    &= q^{'(j)}_{x} \cdot \int \prod_{i \ne j} {}_{t}p^{'(i)}_{x} \\
\end{aligned}
$$

The final expression depends on the number of decrements in the model. The most commonly tested variation is the **two decrement model**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}q^{(1)}_{x}
    &= q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \int {}_{t}p^{'(1)}_{x} \\
    &= q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \int \left(1 - t \cdot {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} \right) \\
    &= q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \left(t - \frac{t^2}{2} {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} \right) \\
    &= t \cdot q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{t}{2} {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} \right) \\
    \\
    \therefore {}_{t}q^{(2)}_{x}
    &= t \cdot q^{'(2)}_{x} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{t}{2} {}_{}q^{'(1)}_{x} \right) \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Less commonly tested is the **Three Decrement Model**. The proof is similar to above, but much more **tedious** due to the additional product. Thus, it is recommended to memorize the result instead:

$$
    {}_{t}q^{(1)}_{x}
    = t \cdot q^{'(1)}_{x} \cdot \left(1 - \frac{t}{2} {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} 
        - \frac{t}{2} {}_{}q^{'(3)}_{x} + \frac{t}{3} {}_{}q^{'(2)}_{x} {}_{}q^{'(3)}_{x} \right)
$$

## **Decrement Combination**

A commonly asked question in the exam is to find the probabilities of termination, given that **different types** of decrements are present in the model.

These types of questions often involve **one or more of the following aspects** which make them complicated:

* Continuous and discrete decrements mixed together
* Continuous decrements competing with each other
* Discrete decrements occuring at fractional ages within the year

### **Life Table Method**

Similar to FAM-L, a good way of simplifying the problem is to create our own **life tables**.

In a multi-decrement setting, $\ell^{(\tau)}_{x}$ represents the **total population** at the beginning while ${}_{t}d^{(j)}_{x}$ represents the terminations due to a **specific decrement** within $t$ years.

Thus, the probability of termination or survival can be calculated as follows:

$$
\begin{aligned}
   {}_{t}q^{(j)}_{x} &= \frac{{}_{t}d^{(j)}_{x}}{\ell^{(\tau)}_{x}} \\
   {}_{t}p^{(\tau)}_{x} &= \frac{\ell^{(\tau)}_{x+t}}{\ell^{(\tau)}_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Technically speaking, all calculations in this section can be solved directly using probability formulas. However, it is much easier and intuitive to use the life table method instead.

### **Ultimate Model**

Consider a model with **four decrements**:

1. Discrete (Acts at the **beginning of year** only)
2. Continuous (Acts throughout the year)
3. Continuous (Acts throughout the year)
4. Discrete (Acts at the **end of year** only)

Decrements 2 and 3 are competing with each other as they are occuring at the same time. Although they act *throughout* the year, they do NOT compete with the discrete decrements that act at a single time point.

!!! Note

    This is similar to the concept of a continuous random variable - they are not defined at a single time point.

<!-- Self Made -->
![Ultimate Model](Assets/2.%20Multi%20Decrement%20Models.md/Ultimate%20Model.png){.center}

Firstly, at the **beginning of the year**:

* Decrement 1 acts **alone**
* Since no other decrement has acted, the **original population** is used as the base

$$
    d^{(1)}_{x} = \ell^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot q^{(1)}_{x}
$$

!!! Note

    Since decrement 1 is acting alone with no competition, there is **NO difference** between the dependent and independent probabilities:

    $$
        q^{(1)}_{x} = q^{'(1)}_{x}
    $$

Secondly, **throughout the year**:

* Decrement 2 and 3 **competes with each other** (Dependent probabilities must be used)
* Since **decrement 1 has acted**, the population must be adjusted accordingly

Using whatever assumption was given, calculate the dependent probabilities for each decrement. Thus, calculate the number of terminations:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    d^{(2)}_{x} &= (\ell^{(\tau)}_{x} - d^{(1)}_{x}) \cdot q^{(2)}_{x} \\
    d^{(3)}_{x} &= (\ell^{(\tau)}_{x} - d^{(1)}_{x}) \cdot q^{(2)}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The same base is used for BOTH decrements. This is because we have **already accounted for interaction** between the two via the dependent probabilities.

Lastly, **at the end of the year**:

* Decrement 4 acts **alone**
* Since **all other decrements have acted**, the population must be adjusted accordingly

$$
    d^{(4)}_{x} = (\ell^{(\tau)}_{x} - d^{(1)}_{x} - d^{(2)}_{x} - d^{(3)}_{x}) \cdot q^{(4)}_{x}
$$

!!! Note

    Similar to decrement 1, there is no difference between the dependent and independent probabilities in this case.

Using the above components, the respective probabilities of termination or survival can be calculated.

!!! Tip

    It is NOT recommended to memorize any of the results in this section as the the situation will change from question to question.

    It is much better to understand the principles behind the calculation so that no matter what combination is given, the probabilities can be easily calculated.

### **Fractional Age**

Consider a two decrement model:

1. Discrete (Acts at the end of the first quarter)
2. Continuous (Acts throughout the year)

<!-- Self Made -->
![Fractional Model](Assets/2.%20Multi%20Decrement%20Models.md/Fractional%20Model.png){.center}

Firstly, **during the first quarter**:

* Decrement 2 acts alone
* Since no other decrement has acted, the original population is used

Assuming that **decrement 2 is UDD**,

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{0.25}q^{(2)}_{x} &= 0.25 \cdot q^{(2)}_{x} \\
    \therefore {}_{0.25}d^{(2)}_{x} &= \ell^{(\tau)}_{x} \cdot 0.25 \cdot q^{(2)}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Secondly, at the **end of the first quarter**:

* Decrement 1 acts alone
* Since no other decrement 1 has acted, the population must be adjusted accordingly

$$
    d^{(1)}_{x} = (\ell^{(\tau)}_{x} - {}_{0.25}d^{(2)}_{x}) \cdot q^{(1)}_{x}
$$

Lastly, for the remaining of the year:

* Decrement 1 acts alone
* Since decrement 1 has acted, the population must be adjusted accordingly

This is **complicated**, as the probability that must be used at this point is a fractional probability:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{0.75}q^{(2)}_{x+0.25}
    &= \frac{{}_{0.75}d^{(2)}_{x+0.25}}{\ell^{(2)}_{x+0.25}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell^{(2)}_{x+0.25} - \ell^{(2)}_{x+0.25}}{\ell^{(2)}_{x+0.25}} \\
    &= \frac{\ell^{(2)}_{x} - 0.25 \cdot d^{(2)}_{x} - (\ell^{(2)}_{x} - d^{(2)}_{x})}
            {\ell^{(2)}_{x} - {}_{0.25}d^{(2)}_{x}} \\
    &= \frac{0.75 d^{(2)}_{x}}{\ell^{(2)}_{x} - {}_{0.25}d^{(2)}_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Although the above probability can be solved using first principles as shown above, the intuition is simple - the **proportion of people** that die in the remaining quarters of the year must remain the same.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{0.75}d^{(2)}_{x+0.25}
    &= (\ell^{(\tau)}_{x} - {}_{0.25}d^{(2)}_{x} - d^{(1)}_{x}) \cdot {}_{0.75}q^{(2)}_{x+0.25} \\
    \\
    \therefore d^{(2)}_{x} &= {}_{0.25}d^{(2)}_{x} + {}_{0.75}d^{(2)}_{x+0.25}
\end{aligned}
$$

## **Insurance Applications**

Multi-decrement assurances and annuities are concpetually similar to their single decrement counterparts - Equivalence Principle, Continuous Discrete Approximation etc.

The key difference is that the benefit is the combination of **multiple benefits**, typically for **each decrement** in the model:

$$
    \text{EPV Benefit} = \text{EPV Benefit 1} + \text{EPV Benefit 2} + \dots
$$

All other calculations remain the same as before.
