# Pensions

## **Overview**

Pensions are an arrangement where an employer makes **regular contributions** into a fund as long as the employee has yet to retire. Upon retirement, contributions will stop and the fund will be drawn down to make **regular payments** to the employee as a form of **retirement benefit** as long as they are alive.

For the purposes of this exam, there are two types of pensions to consider:

<center>

|     **Defined Contribution**      |        **Defined Benefit**        |
| :-------------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
|       Contribution is fixed       |     Contribution is variable      |
|        Benefit is variable        |         Benefit is fixed          |
| Investment risk borne by Employee | Investment risk borne by Employer |
|       Employee selects fund       |      Employer selects funds       |

</center>

!!! Note

    Under a DB pension, if the fund performs **worse than expected**, the employer will **vary their contributions** to ensure that the target payout can be supported. Thus, the downside (risk) of DB plans is **borne by the employer**.

    Conversely, under a DC pension, the employer has **no obligation** to adjust their contributions, thus the **loss in benefit** is borne by the employee via lower benefit payments.

Pensions are within the scope of the exam as they are a form of **contingent cashflows** - contingent on the retirement of the employee.

## **Key Concepts**

### **Salary Projection**

Regardless of the type of pension, employee salary is often used as the driver for the fixed components of the pension. However, an individual's salary tends to **grow over time**, thus must be projected into the future.

### **Replacement Ratio**

## **Defined Contribution**

Defined Contribution plans are a type pension where employer contributions are fixed, defined as some **function of an employee's salary** at the time.

$$
    \text{Contribution}_{t} = \alpha \cdot \text{Salary}_{t} 
$$

The contributions are invested into a pension fund which accumulates over time. **Upon retirement** of the employee, the fund value is used to purchase a **Whole Life Annuity** which will pay the pension benefit to the employee.

The goal is to determine the **expected benefit** that the employee will receive given the contributions. This is done by solving for the **face value of the annuity** based on the accumulated fund value:

$$
    \sum \text{Contribution}_{t} = \text{Retirement Benefit} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65}
$$

!!! Warning

    Retirement benefits are typically paid on a **monthly basis**, which is why the payable 12 times a year annuity function is used.

    However, it is important to remember that the face value of the annuity is assumed to be a **yearly cashflow**. To obtain the monthly benefit, the resulting benefit must be **divided by 12**.

Due to the rather straightforward nature of DC plans, most questions from this topic will **focus on DB plans** instead.

## **Defined Benefit**

Defined Benefit plans are a type pension where the retirement benefits are fixed, defined as some **function of an employee's final salary** upon retirement.

$$
    \text{Retirement Benefit} = n \cdot \text{Final Salary} \cdot \alpha
$$

This can be intepreted as the following: For each **year of employment** $(n)$, the employee is entitled to $\alpha%$ of their **final salary**. The longer an employee works, the greater the
 benefit received.

Even though the term "final salary" is used, its definition varies from plan to plan:

* **Final Average Salary (FAS)**: Average salary over the last few years of employment
* **Career Average Earnings (CAE)**: Average salary over the entire span of employment

!!! Note

    There is a special variation of the career average plan known as the **Career Average Revaluaed Earnings (CARE)**. It considers the average of the **inflation adjusted** salaries of the employee as at retirement.

!!! Warning

    

For a DB plan, the goal is to determine the **expected fund value** needed to support the benefits. This is done by solving for the **EPV** of the life annuity:

$$
    \text{EPV}_{65} = \text{Retirement Benefit} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65}
$$

!!! Note

    A company could offer both a death benefit and retirement benefit in their compensation package. Thus, questions could ask for the **combined EPV** of the benefits.

### **Accrued Benefits**

Legally speaking, an employer can cancel their pension program at any time. However, they must **still make pension payments** to employees based on the number of years they have worked **up to the point of cancellation**.

Based on the above, the liability of a DB program is only the **accrued (earned) portion** of the retirement benefit at any point in time.

Consider an individual who joined the company at age $x$ with a retirement age of 65. At age $y$, their retirement benefit can be **decomposed into two components**:

$$
    (65 - x) \cdot S\alpha
    = \underbrace{(y - x) \cdot S\alpha}_{\text{Accrued Benefit}}
    + \underbrace{(65 - y) \cdot S\alpha}_{\text{Future Service Benefit}}
$$

However, determining only the **accrued benefits** raises a question on how to determine the **final salary**. While the methodology (FAS, CAE) remains the same, the underlying salaries to be used is questionable - should they be projected to retirement or used as at the current age?

<center>

|       **Projected Unit Cost**        |        **Traditional Unit Method**         |
| :----------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------: |
| Accounts for future salary increases | Does not allow for future salary increases |
|  Projects salary to retirement age   |       Uses salary as at current age        |
|          More conservative           |             Less conservative              |

</center>

!!! Tip

    Consider the FAS method for final salary of 3 years:

    * **Projected Method**: Average salaries at age 64, 63 & 62
    * **Traditional Method**: Average salaries at age $y-1$, $y-2$ & $y-3$

!!! Warning

    The above two methods only influence the Final Salary parameter of the benefit definition. It does NOT affect the **number of years of service (n) is the same** for both methods.

Even under an accrued benefits basis, the pension benefits will only **start upon retirement**. Thus, the EPV is first calculated on retirement, then **discounted back to the current age**:

$$
    \text{EPV}_{y} = \text{EPV}_{65} \cdot {}_{65-y}E_{x}
$$

### **Early Retirement**

Some programs also allow for **early retirement**. However, the value of the benefits will be **reduced by a factor** for each year of early retirement, known as the **Pension Reduction Factor**.

$$
    \text{Reduced Benefit}
    = n_{\text{Early}} \cdot \text{Pension Reduction Factor } \cdot \text{Original Benefit}
$$

!!! Warning

    The pension reduction factor is applied *linearly*, not in a compounded manner.

Given early retirement, there are **multiple ages** that the pension payments could start from. The total EPV is the **probability weighted average** of the different EPVs:

$$
    \text{EPV}
    = \text{P(Retire 65)} \cdot \text{EPV}_{65}
    + \text{P(Retire 64)} \cdot \text{EPV}_{64}
    + \dots
$$

The probability of retiring at a certain age is a combination of two probabilities:

* Probability of surviving till retirement age, given that they are currently alive
* Probability of retiring at retirement age, given that they are alive at that age

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{P(Retire at 64)}
    &= \text{P(Survive till 64)} \cdot \text{P(Retire at 64)} \\
    &= \frac{\ell_{64}}{\ell_{x}} \cdot \frac{r_{64}}{\ell_{64}} \\
    &= \frac{r_{64}}{\ell_{x}}
\end{aligned}
$$

Note that the weighted average shown above does not make sense as the EPVs are **discounted to different ages**. Thus, they must be further discounted to the **current valuation age** ($y$) under an **accrued basis** before being combined:

$$
    \text{EPV}
    = \text{P(Retire 65)} \cdot \text{EPV}_{y, \text{Retire 65}}
    + \text{P(Retire 64)} \cdot \text{EPV}_{y, \text{Retire 64}}
    + \dots
$$

!!! Warning

    If the projected method is specified, the each scenario would use a different final salary. For instance, if the average of the final 3 years are used:

    * **Retire at age 65**: Average of salaries at ages 65, 64 & 63
    * **Retire at age 64**: Average of salaries at ages 64, 63 & 62

### **Withdrawal**

Another possible scenario is that the employee **leaves the company** (hence *withdrawing* from the pension program) prior to their retirement. Following the same logic as before, the company is still **obligated** pay the accrued benefits for the years that the employee has worked.

!!! Note

    If the employee joins a new company which also has a pension benefit, they will receive **two sets of retirement benefits** upon from both the old and new company.

Given that an employee can leave the company long before their retirement, most companies offer a basic **Cost of Living Adjustment** (COLA) in the defined benefit to **account for inflation**:

$$
    \text{COLA Benefit} = \text{Original Benefit} * (1 + \text{COLA})^(65-y)
$$

Similar to the early retirement scenario, the EPV of the program is the **probability weighted average** of two scenarios - withdrawal and retirement.

!!! Tip

    Although it is technically possible to withdraw at any age, questions for this topic typically **limit the possible withdrawal ages** for simplicity.
