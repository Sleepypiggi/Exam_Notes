# Pensions

## **Overview**

Pensions are an arrangement where an employer makes **regular contributions** into a fund as long as the employee has yet to retire. Upon retirement, contributions will stop and the fund will be drawn down to make **regular payments** to the employee as a form of **retirement benefit** as long as they are alive.

For the purposes of this exam, there are two types of pensions to consider:

<center>

|                  **Defined Contribution**                   |                     **Defined Benefit**                     |
| :---------------------------------------------------------: | :---------------------------------------------------------: |
|                    Contribution is fixed                    |                  Contribution is variable                   |
|                     Benefit is variable                     |                      Benefit is fixed                       |
|              Investment risk borne by Employee              |              Investment risk borne by Employer              |
| Variable Benefits to Employee, Guaranteed Cost to Employers | Guaranteed Benefits to Employee, Variable Cost to Employers |
|                   Preferred by Employers                    |                   Preferred by Employees                    |

</center>

!!! Note

    Under a DB pension, if the fund performs **worse than expected**, the employer will **vary their contributions** to ensure that the target payout can be supported. Thus, the downside (risk) of DB plans is **borne by the employer**.

    Conversely, under a DC pension, the employer has **no obligation** to adjust their contributions, thus the **loss in benefit** is borne by the employee via lower benefit payments.

Pensions are within the scope of the exam as they are a form of **contingent cashflows** - contingent on the retirement of the employee.

Pensions are offerred for the following reasons:

1. To compete for new employees
2. To retain employees in productive years
3. To improve morale of employees

## **Salary**

### **Key Properties**

Salary is the **most important component** for any pension related problem as all plan types rely on salary as the main driver for the benefits. Thus, it is important to have a strong understanding of how it is treated for this exam:

* Salary is **paid monthly** and is **assumed to be level** throughout the year
* Salary is paid **in arrears**; at the end of the month
* However, most questions are concerned with the **Annual Salary**, denoted as $S_{x}$
* $S_{x}$ is the salary earned by the employee **WHILE** they were age $x$

For the purposes of this exam, an employee is assumed to **retire exactly** on the day that they reach the retirement age (**their birthday**). If an employee retires at age $y+1$, then the last salary they salary they would receive would be while they were aged $y$:

![Retirement_Salary](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Retirement_Salary.png){.center}

!!! Tip

    For most questions, the individual is assumed to **retire at age 65**. Thus, the final annual salary that the individual receives is $S_{64}$.

    When in doubt, always draw a **timeline to visualize** the salaries paid.

!!! Warning

    Some questions may specify that the individuals retire in the **middle of their ages** (EG. Age 64.5). In this case, the final salary is comprised of two components:

    * 6 months of salary from $S_{63}$
    * 6 months of salary from $S_{64}$

    <!-- Self Made -->
    ![Retirement_Salary_MY](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Retirement_Salary_MY.png){.center}

    The above is important because the salary while 63 is usually different while 64.

### **Salary Growth**

For the purposes of the exam, assume that the salary of the employee **grows over time**. Thus, rather than provide a salary schedule, they will provide the **salary at a specified age** and then require students to **manually compute the salary** at the required ages.

Most questions will assume that the **annual salary grows annually**, typically on the employee's birthday:

$$
    S_{x+t} = S_{x} \cdot (1+g)^{t}
$$

!!! Note

    Salary is still assumed to be level throughout the year. Thus, the monthly salary also grows at the same rate:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        S_{x+t}
        &= S_{x} \cdot (1+g)^{t} \\
        &= 12 \cdot \text{Monthly Salary}_{x} \cdot (1+g)^{t} \\
        &= 12 \cdot \text{Monthly Salary}_{x+t}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

However, there are some questions that assume that the **monthly salary grows monthly** instead. In these cases, the salary is **no longer level** throughout the year. Thus, the salary in the individual months must be **summed up to obtain the annual salary** in the year.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    S_{x+t}
    &= \text{Monthly Salary}_{x+t-1} \cdot [1 + (1+j)^{1} + (1+j)^{2} + (1+j)^{3} + \dots] \\
    &= \text{Monthly Salary}_{x+t-1} \cdot s_{\enclose{actuarial}{12} j}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    The accumulation function is for the payments made in **arrears** (not the usual payment in advance) that is usually used for ALTAM:

    $$
        s_{\enclose{actuarial}{12}} = \frac{(1+j)^{12} - 1}{i}
    $$

### **Continuous Salary**

In some rare cases, questions might provide the **Salary Rate** instead. In these cases, the salary also grows at a **continuous rate**.

The same principles from before apply - the annual salary is the **sum of all the salaries** received in the year. In a continuous scenario, the salaries are received every instant. To sum across all instances, integration must be used:

$$
    S_{x+t} = \int^{n}_{n-1} \text{Initial Salary Rate} \cdot e^{\delta t}
$$

### **Replacement Ratio**

The **Replacement Ratio** is the percentage of **FINAL salary** that is replaced by the pension benefit:

$$
    \text{Replacement Ratio}
    = \frac{\text{Yearly Retirement Benefit}}{\text{Final Yearly Salary}}
$$

Most pension plans have a **target replacement ratio** is 50-70%. The ratio does not need to be close to 100% as people typically **require less money while in retirement**.

If an individual has **multiple pension plans** (from different companies or personal plans), then the replacement ratio is calculated based on the **TOTAL retirement benefit** the individual receives.

## **Defined Contribution**

Defined Contribution plans are a type of pension where both the employer (*and sometimes employee*) **contribute a fixed amount** into a fund which accumulates over time. Upon retirement, the fund value is then used to **purchase a Life Annuity** which will pay the pension benefit to the employee.

Thus, the primary goal of these DC questions are to solve for the **yearly retirement benefit** that the employee will receive on retirement:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{AV of Contributions}
    &= \text{EPV DC Benefits}_{65} \\
    &= \text{Yearly DC Benefit} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65}    
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    Retirement benefits are typically paid on a **monthly basis**, which is why the payable 12 times a year annuity function is used.

    However, it is important to remember that the face value of the annuity is assumed to be a **yearly cashflow**. To obtain the monthly benefit, the resulting benefit must be **divided by 12**.

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Defined_Contribution](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Defined_Contribution.png)

The contributions into the fund are defined as a **proportion $(c)$ of the employee's salary** each period:

$$
    \text{DC Contribution}_{t} = c \cdot S_{x+t}
$$

Due to the rather straightforward nature of DC plans, most questions from this topic will **focus on DB plans** instead.

### **Accumulated Value**

The **contribution each period changes** as the employee's salary grows. Thus, it is **NOT possible** to use the typical accumulated value function from exam FM ($s_{x:\enclose{actuarial}{n}}$).

The best approach would be to use first principles via the **Sum of Geometric Series**. It must account for two dimensions:

* Each contribution is different due to **Salary Increases**
* Each contribution earns a different interest due to the **Time Value of Money**

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Sum of AV of Contributions}
    &= a \cdot \frac{r^{n} - 1}{r - 1} \\
    \\
    a &= S_{x} \cdot (1+i)^n \\
    r &= (1+g) \cdot v
\end{aligned}
$$

<!-- Self Made -->
![Salary_Accumulation](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Salary_Accumulation.png){.center}

The key is knowing HOW MANY years to accumulate:

* **Salary Growth**: Starts from 0, ends at $n-1$
* **Accumulation**: Starts from $n$, end at $1$
* In both cases, the total is still $n$ times

!!! Tip

    The same principles apply for a continuous salary, simply convert the discrete components into continuous ones:

    * Summation into Integration
    * Rates into forces

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{Sum of AV of Contributions}
         &= \int^{n}_{0} S_{x} \cdot e^{\delta_{i} t} \cdot e^{(\delta_{g} - \delta_{i}) t}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

### **Different Frequencies**

The above above only works if all components are on the same frequency:

* Salary Contributions
* Salary Growth
* Interest Accumulation

The main issue comes when Contributions are **made monthly** but Growth is **made yearly**. Thus, an additional step must be done to bridge the two together:

<!-- Self Made -->
![Different_Frequencies](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Different_Frequencies.png){.center}

Since salary growth is only made yearly, the contributions **within a given year are constant**. Thus, the accumulated value of the monthly contributions at the end of the year can be expressed using the **accumulation function**:

$$
    \text{Yearly Contribution}
    = S_{x} \cdot c \cdot s_{\enclose{actuarial}{12}}
$$

The above yearly contribution can then be plugged into the usual geometric formula that to determine the accumulated value as at the valuation date.

!!! Tip

    This is similar in principle to the monthly salary growth situation earlier. The key is to **gross up** the components with different frequencies to match the rest.


## **Defined Benefit**

Defined Benefit plans are a type pension where the retirement benefits are fixed, defined as some **function of an employee's final salary** upon retirement. It is the employer's duty to set aside and invest funds to ensure that they are able to pay out the benefit upon retirement.

Thus, the primary goal of these DB questions are to solve for **accumulated value** needed (and hence contributions needed) to fulfill the pension liability:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{DB Liability}
    &= \text{EPV DB Benefits}_{65} \\
    &= \text{Yearly DB Benefit} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65}        
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Some pension plans also offer a death benefit, thus the accumulated value needed should also reflect the EPV of the death benefit as well.

Typically, the benefit is a **proportion** $(\alpha)$ of the employee's *pensionable salary*, for each **year of service** $(n)$ that the employee

$$
    \text{Yearly DB Benefit} = n \cdot \alpha \cdot \text{Pensionable Salary}
$$

*Pensionable Salary* (PS) is a catch all term whose definition varies from plan to plan:

* **Final Salary**: Average Annual salary in the **last year of employment**
* **Final Average Salary**: Average annual salary over the **last few years of employment**
* **Career Average Salary**: Average annual salary over the **entire span of employment**

!!! Warning

    The above methodology is **NOT exhaustive**. It is important to understand the intuition behind how the benefit is determined so that the same principle can be applied to different question scenarios.

!!! Note

    If pensionable salary is the average salary across the entire employment:

    $$
        \text{Total Salary} = n \cdot \text{Career Average Salary}
    $$

    Some questions might instead provide the **total earnings** without the years of service; but note that they are equivalent in this scenario.

!!! Tip

    It is recommended to calculate the Final Salary and the Retirement Benefit **seperately**, as some questions can provide multiple scenarios which require reusing one or more components.

### **Early Retirement**

As stated previously, the default retirement age is 65. However, some programs allow for employees to **retire early** and hence receive their pension earlier.

There are two consequences as a result:

* The years of service and pensionable salary should reflect the earlier retirement age
* Reduction factor is **linearly applied** for the number of years brought forward

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Benefit Reduction} &= (1 - n_\text{Years Early} \cdot \text{Reduction Factor}) \\
    \text{Reduced Benefit} &= \text{Early Benefit} \cdot \text{Reduction Factor}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    It is a common mistake to apply the reduction exponentially:

    $$
        \text{Benefit Reduction} \ne (1 + \text{Reduction Factor})^{n_\text{Years Early}}
    $$

    This mistake can be avoided by understanding that the benefit determination itself is applied linearly, thus the reduction should be on the same basis.

### **Accrued Benefits**

Legally speaking, an employer can cancel their pension program at any time. However, they must **still make pension payments** to employees based on the **number of years** they have worked **up to the point of cancellation**. Thus, the liability of a DB program is only the **accrued (earned) portion** of the retirement benefit at any point in time.

To better understand this, consider the following situation:

* Employee jonined the company at age $x$
* The employee is currently aged $y$ with $(y-x)$ **years of service**
* Retirements occur upon exact age 65

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{Pension Benefit}
    &= (65 - x) \cdot \alpha \cdot \text{PS} \\
    &= [(y - x) + (65-y)] \cdot \alpha \cdot \text{PS} \\
    &= \underbrace{(y - x) \cdot \alpha \cdot \text{PS}}_{\text{Accrued Benefit}}
    + \underbrace{(65-y) \cdot \alpha \cdot \text{PS}}_{\text{Future Service Benefit}}
\end{aligned}
$$

However, this raises a question on the **basis of the pensionable salary**. If the years of service only reflects what is earned so far, should the salary follow the same logic? Thus, there are two different valuation basis:

<center>

|      **Projected Unit Credit**       |        **Traditional Unit Credit**         |
| :----------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------: |
| Accounts for future salary increases | Does not allow for future salary increases |
|  Projects salary to retirement age   |       Uses salary as at current age        |
|          More conservative           |             Less conservative              |
|     EG. PS = S(64), S(63), S(62)     |      EG. PS = S(y-1), S(y-2), S(y-3)       |

</center>

!!! Warning

    The methodology only influences the Pensionable Salary component - the number of years remains based on the accrued amount.

!!! Note

    Naturally, this means that an employee who just joined the pension plan will have no actuarial liability as they do not have any prior years of service.

### **Accrued Liability**

Ultimately, the benefit payments will only start on retirement. Thus, liability must be **discounted back** to the current valuation date to **control for interest and decrements**, known as the **Accrued Liability**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{x}V
    &= \text{EPV DB Benefits}_{65} \cdot v^{65-y} \cdot \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{y}} \\
    &= (y - x) \cdot \alpha \cdot \text{PS} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65} \cdot v^{65-y} \cdot \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{y}}
\end{aligned}
$$

The probability of retirement is a combination of two probabilities:

* Probability of **surviving till retirement age**
* Probability of **retiring at that age**, given that they are alive at that age

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{P(Retire at 65)}
    &= \text{P(Survive till 65)} \cdot \text{P(Retire at 65)} \\
    &= \frac{\ell_{65}}{\ell_{y}} \cdot \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{65}} \\
    &= \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{y}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Most questions will use the following phrasing:

    * Decrements follow standard service table
    * Mortality after retirement follows the Standard Ultimate Life Table

    This means that the retirement probabilities should be obtained from the SST, while the EPV factors should be obtained from the SULT.

!!! Note

    Some questions might provide a scenaro where the employee has **already retired**. In this case, the following aspects should be taken care of:

    * The benefit is based on the **actual salary** as at retirement
    * There is **no need to discount** interest or mortality as the employee has already retired and has started receiving payments

### **Variable Retirement**

Up till this point, we have assumed that there is only one possible retirement age. In reality, individuals could retire across a **range of ages**. In particular, if retirements follow the **Standard Service Table**, then employees could retire from **any age from 60 to 65**:

<!-- Obtained from Society of Actuaries -->
![Standard_Service_Table](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Standard_Service_Table.png){.center}

!!! Note

    To reduce complexity, most questions assume that the employee is **currently aged** 62 or 63 to reduce the range of early ages.

    Alternatively, their assumptions might follow an adjusted table such that **all employees surviving to a specified age** (EG. 62) retire at that age, reducing the range of ages.

The accrued liability must **account for all possibilities** of retiring at each age:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{x}V
    &= \text{EPV DB Benefits}_{65} \cdot v^{65-y} \cdot \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{y}} \\
    &+ \text{EPV DB Benefits}_{64} \cdot v^{64-y} \cdot \frac{r_{64}}{\ell_{y}} \\
    &+ \text{EPV DB Benefits}_{63} \cdot v^{63-y} \cdot \frac{r_{63}}{\ell_{y}} \\
    &+ \dots
\end{aligned}
$$

If the **PUC method** is specified, then each scenario must use a **different pensionable salary**, based on the retirement age in that scenario:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{x}V
    &= n \cdot \alpha \cdot \text{PS}_{65} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65} \cdot v^{65-y} \cdot \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{y}} \\
    &+ n \cdot \alpha \cdot \text{PS}_{64} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{64} \cdot v^{64-y} \cdot \frac{r_{64}}{\ell_{y}} \\
    &+ n \cdot \alpha \cdot \text{PS}_{63} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{63} \cdot v^{63-y} \cdot \frac{r_{63}}{\ell_{y}} \\
    &+ \dots
\end{aligned}
$$

Consequently, if the **TUC method** is specified, then all scenarios would be based on the same retirement benefit. Thus, the expression can be **greatly simplified** to:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{x}V
    &= n \cdot \alpha \cdot \text{PS}_{y} \\
    & \cdot \biggl(\ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65} \cdot v^{65-y} \cdot \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{y}}
    + \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{64} \cdot v^{64-y} \cdot \frac{r_{64}}{\ell_{y}}
    + \dots \biggr)
\end{aligned}
$$

### **Withdrawal**

Another possible scenario is that the employee **leaves the company** (hence *withdrawing* from the pension program) prior to their retirement. The company is still **obligated** pay the accrued benefits for the years that the employee has worked.

!!! Note

    If the employee joins a new company which also has a pension benefit, they will receive **two sets of retirement benefits** upon from both the old and new company.

Allowing for withdrawals adds **another layer of complexity** to the calculation:

<!-- Self Made -->
![Withdrawal_Benefit](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Withdrawal_Benefit.png){.center}

Similar to variable retirements, the accrued liability must account for the possibility of **withdrawing at every possible age**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{x}V
    &= \text{EPV Withdrawal}_{z} \cdot v^{z-y} \cdot \frac{w_{z}}{\ell_{y}} \\
    &+ \text{EPV Withdrawal}_{z+1} \cdot v^{z+1-y} \cdot \frac{w_{z+1}}{\ell_{y}} \\
    &+ \text{EPV Withdrawal}_{z+2} \cdot v^{z+2-y} \cdot \frac{w_{z+2}}{\ell_{y}} \\
    &+ \dots
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    However, due to the sheer number of possible retirements, most questions will most definitely **limit the ages to a specified range**.

The EPV of withdrawals can be expressed as:

$$
    \text{EPV Withdraw}_{z}
    = \text{EPV DB Benefits}_{65} \cdot v^{65-z} \cdot \frac{\ell_{65}}{\ell_{z}} 
$$

!!! Note

    In order to simplify this process, some questions might provide a **specialized annuity factor** that can directly calculate the EPV of future retirement benefits **as at the withdrawal date**.

## **DB Funding**

As stated previously, it is the employer's duty to ensure that they have sufficient funds to cover the DB pension liability. Thus, employers hols a **reserve** equal to the accrued liability of the pension at the time of valuation (hence the notation).

As the employees move towards retirement, the accrued liability increases, forcing the employer to **increase their reserves**. The **extent of the reserve increase** (after controlling for mortality and interest) is the amount that the **contribution needed** $(C_{t})$ for that period.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{t}V + C_{t} &= {}_{t+1}V \cdot vp_{x} \\
    C_{t} &= {}_{t+1}V \cdot vp_{x} - {}_{t}V 
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    The contribution needed is sometimes referred to as the Normal Cost of the pension. Functionally, it is **equivalent to the premium** that the plan receives.

Similarly, since there are two different valuation methodologies, there will be a different contribution amount for each method.

### **PUC Method**

Using the PUC method, the **pensionable salary** is projected to retirement, regardless of the valuation year. Thus, the pensionable salary is **constant across time**.

Thus, consider the following key ideas about how the two accrued liabilities are different:

* Both assume payments **start on the same retirement age**
* Both are on the **same basis** (discounted to the same time period)
* Both are based on the **same pensionable salary**
* **Key difference is the years of service** - liability as at $t+1$ has earned **one more year** of salary

!!! Note

    Recall that the future accrued liability is controlled for interest and mortality. This means that the cashflows are **discounted to the same time point**.

Given that there is only **one key difference**, the ${}_{t+1}V$ can be expressed as a function of ${}_{t}V$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    vp_{x} \cdot {}_{t+1}V
    &= vp_{x} \cdot \text{AB}_{t+1} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65} \cdot v^{65-(y+1)} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{y+1}} \\
    &= \text{AB}_{t+1} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65} \cdot v^{65-y} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{y}} \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot \text{AB}_{t} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65} \cdot v^{65-y} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{y}} \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot {}_{t}V \\
    \\
    \text{AB}_{t+1}
    &= (n+1) \cdot \alpha \cdot \text{PS}_{65} \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot n \cdot \alpha \cdot  \text{PS}_{65} \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot \text{AB}_{t} \\
    \\
    \therefore C_{t}
    &= {}_{t+1}V \cdot vp_{x} - {}_{t}V \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot {}_{t}V - {}_{t}V \\
    &= \left(\frac{n+1}{n} - 1 \right) \cdot {}_{t}V \\
    &= \frac{1}{n} \cdot {}_{t}V
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    The above expression can be shown WITHOUT proof. This will greatly save time on the exam.

Thus, the contribution under a PUC basis is the liability solely for an **additional year of accruals** - which is calculated as the **average yearly liability** of the current liability.

### **TUC Method**

Using the TUC method, the pensionable salary is based on the **current salary** as at the valuation date. This means that the liability at $t+1$ is based on a **different pensionable salary** compared to the liability at $t$.

However, the approach is still the same. The goal is convert the **re-express the liability** at $t+1$ as a function of the liability at $t$:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    vp_{x} \cdot {}_{t+1}V
    &= vp_{x} \cdot \text{AB}_{t+1} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65} \cdot v^{65-(y+1)} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{y+1}} \\
    &= \text{AB}_{t+1} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65} \cdot v^{65-y} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{y}} \\
    &= (1+g) \cdot \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot \text{AB}_{t} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65} \cdot v^{65-y} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{y}} \\
    &= (1+g) \cdot \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot {}_{t}V \\
    \\
    \text{AB}_{t+1}
    &= (n+1) \cdot \alpha \cdot \text{PS}_{t+1} \\
    &= (1+g) \cdot \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot n \cdot \alpha \cdot \text{PS}_{t} \\
    &= (1+g) \cdot \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot \text{AB}_{t} \\
    \\
    \therefore C_{t}
    &= {}_{t+1}V \cdot vp_{x} - {}_{t}V \\
    &= (1+g) \cdot \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot {}_{t}V - {}_{t}V \\
    &= \left((1+g) \cdot \frac{n+1}{n} - 1 \right) \cdot {}_{t}V \\
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, the contribution under a TUC basis reflects two items:

* An additional year of accruals
* An additional year of salary increases for all previously earned benefits

### **Comparison**

Questions tend to ask what is the **difference** between the contribution rates under PUC and TUC methods respectively. Firstly, it is important to understand that both methods result in the **same total funding**:

![Final_Funding](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Final_Funding.png){.center}

The difference lies in the path taken to get there. Generally speaking,

* PUC contributions **start higher** but **increase slower** than TUC
* TUC contributes **become higher around $\frac{2}{3}$** of the maximum employment period

Thus, use the time to retirement as a **sense check** for which should be higher. Most questions give a scenario close to retirement, thus TUC should generally be higher.

It is important to understand why the above occurs:

* Both methodologies result in contributions that **increase over time** as they must reflect the **additional years of earned service** over time
* PUC approach **pre-pays** for all future salary increases, which is why it starts higher
* TUC approach pays for salary increases **as they come**, which includes paying to **upgrade all past accruals** for the salary increase
* At older ages, the past accruals become **extremely large**, resulting in steep increases over time

![Contribution_Rates](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Contribution_Rates.png){.center}

!!! Note

    The main reason why the normal cost is needed is to **cover for the additional year of accruals** (due to years of service and/or salary). It is **NOT due to interest or mortality** - if the experience follows as assumed, the current fund value will be sufficient to support the liability at retirement.

    However, since the **retirement benefit increases each year of service**, the **liability increases** which is why there must be an additional normal contribution each period to account for the increase. This is why there are no normal contributions past retirement - because the **retirement benefit is fixed**.

### **Contribution Ratio**

Similar to replacement ratio, one common metric is also the Contribution Ratio - which measures the proportion of the employee's **salary for that year**:

$$
    \text{Contribution Ratio} = \frac{\text{Contribution}}{\text{Salary}}
$$

!!! Warning

    The salary is **different** from the salary used to compute the benefits, especially if using **TUC method**:

### **Mid Year Retirements**

Some questions provide a scenario where they assume retirements occur in the middle of ages instead - EG. employees who were supposed to retire at 63 **instead retire at 63.5**.

!!! Warning

    When determining **ACCRUED** benefits, the years of service should still reflect the years **as at the valuation date**.

    It is only when determining the **ACTUAL** benefits, that the **additional half year of service** is accounted for.

The key complication comes from a funding perspective. Using the previous formula, the mid-year retirement is **NOT accounted** for. Thus, if mid-year retirements are present, the following should be used instead:

$$
    {}_{t}V + C_{t} = vp_{x} \cdot {}_{t+1}V + v^{0.5} {}_{0.5}r_{x} \cdot \text{EPV Mid Year Retirements}
$$

!!! Note

    The intuition for the reserve recursion follows any other insurance product. The current reserve must be sufficient to cover any **outflows in the period** (mid-year retirements) and **set-up the next reserve** (accrued liability at $t+1$). Any **shortfall must be funded** to ensure reserve adequacy.

    In particular, there would be a **release in reserve** to cover the expected outflow. However, due to the valuation basis, the reserve provision will always be **insufficient** to cover the expected outgo:

    * Reserve provision uses **$n$ years** of accrued service (as at valuation time)
    * Expected outgo uses **$n+0.5$ years** accrued of service (as at expected retirement)

    Thus, mid-year exits will **increase the contribution** for the year, all else equal.

Unfortunately, there is no way to easily simplify the above expression to quickly determine the normal contribution. It will require manual calculation via **first principles**.

## **Post Retirement**

The normal contribution is **invested into a pension fund**. The goal is that by retirement, the pension program is fully funded - the **fund value is equal to the actuarial liability**.

During retirement, the pension fund is **drawn down** to pay for the pension benefits as they arise. Thus, the **profit or loss** of the program is the difference between the pension fund and the actuarial liability:

* Pension fund assets may grow at a different rate than what was assumed in liability calculation
* Pension members may have a different mortality than what was experienced

The key difficulty is determining the pension fund value at a future time, **after taking into account the withdrawals**. The most intuitive method would be to:

1. Assume that there are **no withdrawals**, grow the **entire fund** by the growth rate
2. Determine the accumulated value of the **withdrawals only** during the time at the assumed growth rate
3. Take the **difference** between the two

$$
    \text{FV}_{t+n} = \text{FV}_{t} \cdot (1+g)^{n} - \text{Retirement Benefit} \cdot \ddot{s}_{\enclose{actuarial}{n}} 
$$

## **Health Benefits**

Alongside pensions, employers sometimes also offer **Health Benefits** to their employees in retirement. Operationally, this is done by **sponsoring a health insurance policy** for the employee for as long as they live post retirement.

Similarly, the goal is to determine how much an employer needs to contribute while an employee is working in order to fund the health benefit.

### **Health Valuation**

Firstly, the expected amount of health insruance premiums payable must be determined. The key is to understand that health insurance **premiums tend to increase over time** due to:

* **Age**: Reflecting higher probability of claims; growth rate $a$
* **Inflation**: Reflecting higher cost of healthcare; growth rate $b$

$$
    P_{65+t} = P_{65} \cdot (1+a)^{t} \cdot (1+b)^{t}
$$

!!! Warning

    The years compounded might not be the same for both factors. Consider an individual is currently aged $x$, but the salary provided is for an individual aged $x+t$.

    * Attained Age Growth: $65 - x$
    * Inflation Growth: $65 - (x+t)$

    Read the question carefully and apply the correct factors. 

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV Health Benefits}_{65}
    &= \sum P_{65} \cdot (1+a)^{k} \cdot (1+b)^{k} \cdot v^{k} \cdot {}_{k}p_{x} \\
    &= P_{65} \sum \left(\frac{(1+a)(1+b)}{(1+i)} \right)^{k} \cdot {}_{k}p_{x} \\
    &= P_{65} \sum \frac{1}{(1+i^{*})^{k}} \cdot {}_{k}p_{x} \\
    &= P_{65} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65 \mid i^{*}} \\
    \\
    \frac{1}{(1+i^{*})} &= \frac{(1+a)(1+b)}{(1+i)} \\
    (1+i^{*}) &= \frac{(1+i)}{(1+a)(1+b)} \\
    i^{*} &= \frac{(1+i)}{(1+a)(1+b)} - 1
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Depending on the information given, the initial retirement premium might already have some growth baked into it. Simply **factorize out the excess** to mimic the standard annuity formula:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{EPV Health Benefits}_{x}
        &= P_{x} (1+a)^{10} (1+b)^{15} + P_{x} \cdot v(1+a)^{11} (1+b)^{16} + P_{x} \cdot v^{2} (1+a)^{12} (1+b)^{17} + \dots \\
        &= P_{x} (1+a)^{10} (1+b)^{15} [1 + v(1+a)(1+b) + v^{2} (1+a)^{2} (1+a)^{2} + \dots] \\
        &= P_{x} (1+a)^{10} (1+b)^{15} [1 + (1+i^{*})^{-1} + (1+i^{*})^{-2} + \dots] \\
        &= P_{x} (1+a)^{10} (1+b)^{15} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x \mid i^{*}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

The value of the benefits as at the current date is known as the **Actuarial Value of Total Health Benefits** (AVTHB):

$$
    \text{AVTHB}_{x} = \text{EPV}_{65} \cdot v^{65-y} \cdot \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{x}}
$$

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![AVTHB_Illustration](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/AVTHB_Illustration.png){.center}

Note that unlike Pensions, the **AVTHB is NOT the accrued liability** of the plan. Instead, the Accrued Liability is based on a **linear accrual** of the AVTHB:

* n: Number of years worked
* k: Number of years to retirement

$$
    {}_{x}V = \frac{n}{n+k} \cdot \text{AVTHB}_{x}
$$

There are two methodologies for the accruals:

* **Pro-Rata Method**: Assume accrual to the **EARLIEST** possible retirement age
* **Other Method**: Assume accrual to **EACH** possible retirement age

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{x}V_{\text{Pro Rata}}
    &= \frac{n}{n+k_{\text{Earliest}}} \cdot \text{AVTHB}_{\text{Earliest}} \\
    \\
    {}_{x}V_{\text{Other}}
    &= \sum \frac{n}{n+k} \cdot \text{AVTHB}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    This section is confusing because the concepts are similar to pensions but the execution is slightly different:

    * **Pensions**: Accrual affects the pensionable benefit, which is included in the EPV
    * **Health**: Accrual and EPV seperated into **two steps**

### **Health Funding**

Similar to pensions, the employer holds a reserve equal to the **Accrued Liability** of the plan. Assuming Pro-Rata accruals, the contributions are determined using the **same approach**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    C_{t}
    &= {}_{t+1}V \cdot vp_{x} - {}_{t}V \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n+k} \cdot \text{AVTHB}_{x+1} \cdot vp_{x} - \frac{n}{n+k} \cdot \text{AVTHB}_{x} \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n+k} \cdot \text{AVTHB}_{x} - \frac{n}{n+k} \cdot \text{AVTHB}_{x} \\
    &= \frac{1}{n+k} \cdot \text{AVTHB}_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Warning

    The formula LOOKS similar to the Pension one but it is different:

    * **Pensions**: Years of service & accrued liability
    * **Health**: Years to retirement & AVTHB

    Conceptually, is it similar to the pension contribution under a **PUC basis** - both are essentially just accounting for an **additional year of accruals**, since the health benefit does not change with accruals.

If the accrued liabilities was **accrued to each possible age**, then the total contribution needed is the SUM of the contributions requried for each possible age:

$$
    C_{t} = \sum \frac{1}{n+k} \cdot \text{AVTHB}_{x}
$$

The contributions under a pro-rata method will **always be higher** than that of the each possible retirement age:

* **Pro-rata**: Plan must be **fully funded** by the earliest possible retirement age (EG. Benefits at 65 fully funded **by 60**)
* **Other**: Plan is funded up till the specified retiement age (EG. Benefits at 65 fully funded **by 65**)
* Under a pro-rata basis, there is **less time** to fund the plan, thus **each contribution must be higher** (all else equal)
