# Pensions

## **Overview**

Pensions are an arrangement where an employer makes **regular contributions** into a fund as long as the employee has yet to retire. Upon retirement, contributions will stop and the fund will be drawn down to make **regular payments** to the employee as a form of **retirement benefit** as long as they are alive.

For the purposes of this exam, there are two types of pensions to consider:

<center>

|     **Defined Contribution**      |        **Defined Benefit**        |
| :-------------------------------: | :-------------------------------: |
|       Contribution is fixed       |     Contribution is variable      |
|        Benefit is variable        |         Benefit is fixed          |
| Investment risk borne by Employee | Investment risk borne by Employer |
|       Employee selects fund       |      Employer selects funds       |

</center>

!!! Note

    Under a DB pension, if the fund performs **worse than expected**, the employer will **vary their contributions** to ensure that the target payout can be supported. Thus, the downside (risk) of DB plans is **borne by the employer**.

    Conversely, under a DC pension, the employer has **no obligation** to adjust their contributions, thus the **loss in benefit** is borne by the employee via lower benefit payments.

Pensions are within the scope of the exam as they are a form of **contingent cashflows** - contingent on the retirement of the employee.

Pensions are offerred for the following reasons:

1. To compete for new employees
2. To retain employees in productive years
3. To improve morale of employees

## **Key Concepts**

### **Salary Projection**

Let $S_{x}$ be the **Annual Salary** of an employee aged $x$, earned WHILE they are aged $x$:

![Annual_Salary](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Annual_Salary.png){.center}

Salary is the key driver behind both types of pensions covered. Salary tends to grow over time, thus there must be defined methodology to **project one's salary over time**.

The simplest method is to assume a **Constant Growth Rate** between years:

$$
    S_{x+t} = S_{x} \cdot (1+g)^{t}
$$

A more flexible method be to use a **Salary Scale**, where unique growth patterns can be used:

$$
    S_{x+t} = S_{x} \cdot \underbrace{\frac{s_{x+t}}{s_{x}}}_{\text{Salary Scale}}
$$

Salary scales can either be defined via a **formula**, or via a **table of values** if they do not follow a specific pattern:

![Salary_Scale](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Salary_Scale.png){.center}

### **Replacement Ratio**

The **Replacement Ratio** is the percentage of pre-retirement income that is replaced by the pension benefit:

$$
    \text{Replacement Ratio} = \frac{\text{Retirement Benefit}}{\text{Final Salary}}
$$

!!! Warning

    Final Salary in this context is the **literal meaning** of the word - the last salary that the employee would receive at the company.

Most pension plans have a **target replacement ratio** is 50-70%. The ratio does not need to be close to 100% as people typically require less money while in retirement.

If an individual has multiple pension plans (from different companies or personal plans), then the replacement ratio is calculated based on the **TOTAL retirement benefit** the individual receives.

### **Standard Service Table**

<!-- TBC -->

## **Defined Contribution**

Defined Contribution plans are a type pension where employer contributions are fixed, defined as some **function of an employee's salary** at the time.

$$
    \text{Contribution}_{t} = \alpha \cdot \text{Salary}_{t} 
$$

The contributions are invested into a pension fund which accumulates over time. **Upon retirement** of the employee, the fund value is used to purchase a **Whole Life Annuity** which will pay the pension benefit to the employee.

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Defined_Contribution](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Defined_Contribution.png)

The goal is to determine the **expected benefit** that the employee will receive given the contributions. This is done by solving for the **face value of the annuity** based on the accumulated fund value:

$$
    \sum \text{Contribution}_{t} = \text{Retirement Benefit} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65}
$$

!!! Warning

    Retirement benefits are typically paid on a **monthly basis**, which is why the payable 12 times a year annuity function is used.

    However, it is important to remember that the face value of the annuity is assumed to be a **yearly cashflow**. To obtain the monthly benefit, the resulting benefit must be **divided by 12**.

Due to the rather straightforward nature of DC plans, most questions from this topic will **focus on DB plans** instead.

## **Defined Benefit**

Defined Benefit plans are a type pension where the retirement benefits are fixed, defined as some **function of an employee's final salary** upon retirement.

$$
    \text{Retirement Benefit} = n \cdot \text{Final Salary} \cdot \alpha
$$

This can be intepreted as the following: For each **year of employment** $(n)$, the employee is entitled to $\alpha%$ of their **final salary**. The longer an employee works, the greater the
 benefit received.

Even though the term "final salary" is used, its definition varies from plan to plan:

* **Final Average Salary (FAS)**: Average salary over the last few years of employment
* **Career Average Earnings (CAE)**: Average salary over the entire span of employment
* **Career Average Revaluad Earnings (CARE)**: Same as CAE, but salaries are **adjusted for inflation** as at retirement

!!! Tip

    The total salary (which is used to determine average salary) can be easily calculated using the **Sum of Geometric Series**:

    $$
        \text{Total Salary} = a \cdot \frac{(1+g)^{n} - 1}{(1+g) - 1}
    $$

!!! Warning

    If an employee retires exactly upon reaching age 65, then the **LAST salary** they drew was when they were at 64:

    <!-- Self Made -->
    ![Final_Salary_Example](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Final_Salary_Example.png){.center}

    When it doubt, use the above illustration to count the number of salaries earned.
    
For a DB plan, the goal is to determine the **expected fund value** needed to support the benefits. This is done by solving for the **EPV** of the life annuity:

$$
    \text{EPV}_{65} = \text{Retirement Benefit} \cdot \ddot{a}^{(12)}_{65}
$$

!!! Note

    A company could offer both a death benefit and retirement benefit in their compensation package. Thus, questions could ask for the **combined EPV** of the benefits.

!!! Tip

    It is recommended to calculate the Final Salary and the Retirement Benefit **seperately**, as some questions can provide multiple scenarios which require reusing one or more components.

### **Accrued Benefits**

Legally speaking, an employer can cancel their pension program at any time. However, they must **still make pension payments** to employees based on the number of years they have worked **up to the point of cancellation**.

Based on the above, the liability of a DB program is only the **accrued (earned) portion** of the retirement benefit at any point in time.

Consider an individual who joined the company at age $x$ with a retirement age of 65. At age $y$, their retirement benefit can be **decomposed into two components**:

$$
    (65 - x) \cdot S\alpha
    = \underbrace{(y - x) \cdot S\alpha}_{\text{Accrued Benefit}}
    + \underbrace{(65 - y) \cdot S\alpha}_{\text{Future Service Benefit}}
$$

However, determining only the **accrued benefits** raises a question on how to determine the **final salary**. While the methodology (FAS, CAE) remains the same, the underlying salaries to be used is questionable - should they be projected to retirement or used as at the current age?

<center>

|      **Projected Unit Credit**       |        **Traditional Unit Credit**         |
| :----------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------: |
| Accounts for future salary increases | Does not allow for future salary increases |
|  Projects salary to retirement age   |       Uses salary as at current age        |
|          More conservative           |             Less conservative              |

</center>

!!! Tip

    Consider the FAS method for final salary of 3 years:

    * **PUC**: Average salaries at age 64, 63 & 62
    * **TUC**: Average salaries at age $y-1$, $y-2$ & $y-3$

!!! Warning

    The above two methods only influence the Final Salary parameter of the benefit definition. Years of service (n) is the same under both methods.

Regardless of which method is chosen, the benefit payments will only **start upon retirement**. Thus, the benefits as at retirement must be **discounted** back to the current age to account for **interest** and **probability of retirement**.

$$
    \text{Accrued Liability} = \text{EPV}_{65} \cdot v^{65-y} \cdot \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{y}}
$$

!!! Tip

    The probability of retirement is a combination of two probabilities:

    * Probability of **surviving till retirement age**
    * Probability of **retiring at that age**, given that they are alive at that age

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        \text{P(Retire at 64)}
        &= \text{P(Survive till 64)} \cdot \text{P(Retire at 64)} \\
        &= \frac{\ell_{64}}{\ell_{x}} \cdot \frac{r_{64}}{\ell_{64}} \\
        &= \frac{r_{64}}{\ell_{x}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$


### **Early Retirement**

Some programs also allow for **early retirement**. In these cases, the final salary is calculated based on the **earlier retirement age**.

Furthermore, the value of the benefits will also be **reduced by a factor** for each year of early retirement, known as the **Pension Reduction Factor**: 

$$
    \text{Reduced Benefit}
    = \text{Original Benefit} \cdot (1 - n_{\text{Early}} \cdot \text{Pension Reduction Factor})
$$

!!! Warning

    Do **NOT** apply the reduction factor in a compounded manner:

    $$
        \text{Two Year Reduction} \ne (1 + \text{Reduction Factor})^{n}
    $$

Given early retirement, there are **multiple ages** that the pension payments could start from. The total accrued liability is the sum of the individual accrued liabilities at each retirement age:

$$
    \text{Accrued Liability}
    = \text{Accrued Liability}_{65} + \text{Accrued Liability}_{64} + \dots
$$

There is no need to **weight** the accrued liabilities because the formula for each accrued liability already accounts for the probability of retiring at that age, which is technically the "weight" in the computation. 

!!! Warning

    If the PUC method is specified, the each scenario would use a different final salary. For instance, if the average of the final 3 years are used:

    * **Retire at age 65**: Average of salaries at ages 65, 64 & 63
    * **Retire at age 64**: Average of salaries at ages 64, 63 & 62

### **Withdrawal**

Another possible scenario is that the employee **leaves the company** (hence *withdrawing* from the pension program) prior to their retirement. Following the same logic as before, the company is still **obligated** pay the accrued benefits for the years that the employee has worked.

!!! Note

    If the employee joins a new company which also has a pension benefit, they will receive **two sets of retirement benefits** upon from both the old and new company.

Given that an employee can leave the company long before their retirement, most companies offer a basic **Cost of Living Adjustment** (COLA) in the defined benefit to **account for inflation**:

$$
    \text{COLA Benefit} = \text{Original Benefit} * (1 + \text{COLA})^(65-y)
$$

Similarly to before, the total accrued liability of the program is the **sum of the individual accrued liabilities** of the possible withdrawals and retirements.

!!! Tip

    Although it is technically possible to withdraw at any age, questions for this topic typically **limit the possible withdrawal ages** for simplicity.

## **Funding DB Pensions**

The main goal when analyzing a DB pension is to **determine the contributions** needed for that year in order to maintain the pension:

* Company holds a **reserve equal to the accrued liability**
* Company makes a **contribution** into the reserve in order to **meet the target reserve** for the next period

Let $C_{n}$ be the **Normal Contribution** (sometimes known as **Normal Cost**) needed at year $n$, where $n$ is the service years at the time:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n}V &= \text{Accrued Liability} \\
    {}_{n}V + C_{n} &= {}_{n+1}V \cdot vp_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Note

    Between time $n$ and $n+1$, the individual **cannot retire**. Thus, only **interest and the survival probability** need to be accounted for.

Given that there two different reserving methodologies, there will be two different contribution rates as well based on each method.

### **PUC Method**

Under the PUC method, salary is projected till retirement. **Regardless of the valuation year**, the salary parameter **remains constant**. Thus, the reserves at time $n$ and $n+1$ are based on the **same salary**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n}V
    &= n \alpha S_{65} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65} \cdot v^{65-x} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n}} \\
    {}_{n+1}V
    &= (n+1) \alpha S_{65} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65} \cdot v^{65-x-1} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n+1}} \\
    \\
    {}_{n+1}V \cdot vp_{x}
    &= {}_{n+1}V \cdot v \frac{\ell_{n+1}}{\ell_{n}} \\
    &= (n+1) \alpha S_{65} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65} \cdot v^{65-x} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n}} \\
    &= (n+1) \alpha S_{65} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65} \cdot v^{65-x} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n}} \\
    &= \frac{n}{n} \cdot (n+1) \alpha S_{65} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65} \cdot v^{65-x} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n}} \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot n \alpha S_{65} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65} \cdot v^{65-x} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n}} \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot {}_{n}V \\
    \\
    \therefore C_{n}
    &= {}_{n+1}V \cdot vp_{x} - {}_{n}V \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot {}_{n}V - {}_{n}V \\
    &= \left(\frac{n+1}{n} - 1 \right) \cdot {}_{n}V \\
    &= \frac{n+1-n}{n} \cdot {}_{n}V \\
    &= \frac{1}{n} \cdot {}_{n}V
\end{aligned}
$$

This can be intepreted as the contribution on a PUC basis being equal to the **average yearly accrued liability**. The contribution is **purely** to cover the **addittional year of accruals** when moving later by one valuation year.

### **TUC Method**

Under the TUC method, the **most recent salary** as at the time of valuation is used. This means that the reserves at time $n$ and $n+1$ are based on **different salaries**.

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n}V
    &= n \alpha S_{n} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65} \cdot v^{65-x} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n}} \\
    {}_{n+1}V
    &= (n+1) \alpha S_{n+1} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65} \cdot v^{65-x-1} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n+1}} \\
    \\
    {}_{n+1}V \cdot vp_{x} 
    &= {}_{n+1}V \cdot v \frac{\ell_{n+1}}{\ell_{n}} \\
    &= (n+1) \alpha S_{n+1} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65} \cdot v^{65-x} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n}}  \\
    &= (n+1) \alpha S_{n+1} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65} \cdot v^{65-x} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n}}  \\
    &= \frac{n}{n} \cdot \frac{S_{n}}{S_{n}} \cdot
        (n+1) \alpha S_{n+1} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65} \cdot v^{65-x} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n}}  \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot \frac{S_{n+1}}{S_{n}} \cdot
        n \alpha S_{n} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65} \cdot v^{65-x} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n}}  \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot \frac{S_{n+1}}{S_{n}} \cdot {}_{n}V \\
    \\
    \therefore C_{n}
    &= {}_{n+1}V \cdot vp_{x} - {}_{n}V \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot \frac{S_{n+1}}{S_{n}} \cdot {}_{n}V - {}_{n}V \\
    &= \left(\frac{(n+1) S_{n+1}}{n S_{n}} - 1 \right) {}_{n}V \\
    &= \frac{n S_{n+1} + S_{n+1} - n S_{n}}{n S_{n}} \cdot {}_{n}V \\
    &= \frac{n (S_{n+1} - n S_{n}) + S_{n+1}}{n S_{n}} \cdot {}_{n}V \\
    &= \frac{n (S_{n+1} - n S_{n})}{n S_{n}} \cdot {}_{n}V + \frac{S_{n+1}}{n S_{n}} \cdot {}_{n}V \\
    &= \underbrace{\left(\frac{S_{n+1}}{S_{n}} - 1 \right) \cdot {}_{n}V}_{\text{Salary Increase}}
    + \underbrace{\frac{1}{n} \cdot \frac{S_{n+1}}{S_{n}} \cdot {}_{n}V}_{\text{Addittional Accrual Year}}
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    This can be intepreted as the contribution on a TUC basis being the sum of two components in a **stepwise fashion**:

    * Reflecting the **annual increase in salary**
    * Reflecting the **additional year of accrual**, after accounting for new salary

### **Comparison**

Regardless of which method is used, the **total amount funded remains the same**:

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Final_Funding](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Final_Funding.png){.center}

There is an interesting relationship between the yearly contributions:

* PUC contributions **start higher** because they use the **final salary** of the employee (which is **always larger** than the current salary under TUC)
* As a result, PUC contributions are more **stable** as they only need to account for additional accrual years

<!-- Obtained from Coaching Actuaries -->
![Contribution_Rates](Assets/8.%20Pensions.md/Contribution_Rates.png){.center}

### **Mid Year Retirements**

The above analysis is based on the scenario that there are **no other cashflows** between the two reserves other than the contribution. However, consider the following scenario:

* **Early retirements** are allowed (EG. Age 63, 64)
* Early retirements **occur in the middle** of the year (EG. Age 63.5, 64.5)
* We want to determine the contribution for a year **between retirement ages** (EG. Age 63)

Notice that the reserve at time $n+1$ would **no longer consider** the early retirement. Thus, **reserves have been released** to consider this possibility. Thus, the cashflows must consider the **expected outgo** of the early retirement:

$$
    {}_{n}V + C_{n} - \text{Expected Outgo} = {}_{n+1}V \cdot vp_{x}
$$

TBC DIAGRAM

!!! Tip

    Notice that in principle, this is similar to the **profit formula** for a typical insurance contract. However, there is a key difference:

    * Insurance: Pays a lump sum benefit; Expected Outgo is a **cashflow**
    * Annuity: Pays a stream of benefits; Expected Outgo is an **EPV** of the stream

In profit analysis, if the projection basis is identical to the reserving basis, the release in reserves would **fully offset** the expected outgo. However, this may not be the case depending on the **basis**:

* Fractional years of service are counted **Pro Rata** (Proportionally)
* Expected outgo uses **23.5 years** accrued of service (as at expected retirement)
* Reserve provision uses **23 years** of accrued service (as at valuation time)

Thus, a difference in basis would result in the reserve provision being **insufficient** to cover the expected outgo. This shortfall will be **funded by the contribution** to be made in that year.

!!! Warning

    Naturally, the simplified expressions for the contribution will NOT hold true in this scenario. It will require manual calculation via **first principles**.

## **Health Benefits**

Alongside pensions, employers sometimes also offer **Health Benefits** to their employees in retirement. Operationally, this is done by **sponsoring a health insurance policy** for the employee for as long as they live post retirement.

Similarly, the goal is to determine how much an employer needs to contribute while an employee is working in order to fund the health benefit.

### **Health Accrued Liability**

Firstly, the expected amount of health insruance premiums payable must be determined. The key is to understand that health insurance **premiums tend to increase over time** due to:

* **Age**: Reflecting higher probability of claims; growth rate $a$
* **Inflation**: Reflecting higher cost of healthcare; growth rate $b$

$$
    P_{65+t} = P_{65} \cdot (1+a)^{n} \cdot (1+b)^{n}
$$

!!! Warning

    The years compounded might not be the same for both factors. Consider an individual is currently aged $x$, but the salary provided is for an individual aged $x+t$.

    * Attained Age Growth: $65 - x$
    * Inflation Growth: $65 - (x+t)$

    Read the question carefully and apply the correct factors. 

Notice that the resulting EPV of premiums is a **Geometric Life Annuity**:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    \text{EPV}_{65}
    &= \sum P_{65} \cdot (1+a)^{k} \cdot (1+b)^{k} \cdot v^{k} \cdot {}_{k}p_{x} \\
    &= P_{65} \sum \left(\frac{(1+a)(1+b)}{(1+i)} \right)^{k} \cdot {}_{k}p_{x} \\
    &= P_{65} \sum \frac{1}{(1+i^{*})^{k}} \cdot {}_{k}p_{x} \\
    &= P_{65} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65 \mid i^{*}} \\
    \\
    \frac{1}{(1+i^{*})} &= \frac{(1+a)(1+b)}{(1+i)} \\
    (1+i^{*}) &= \frac{(1+i)}{(1+a)(1+b)} \\
    i^{*} &= \frac{(1+i)}{(1+a)(1+b)} - 1
\end{aligned}
$$

!!! Tip

    Depending on the information given, the initial retirement premium might already have some growth baked into it. Simply **factorize out the excess** to mimic the standard annuity formula:

    $$
    \begin{aligned}
        EPV_{x}
        &= P_{x} (1+a)^{10} (1+b)^{15} + P_{x} \cdot v(1+a)^{11} (1+b)^{16} + P_{x} \cdot v^{2} (1+a)^{12} (1+b)^{17} + \dots \\
        &= P_{x} (1+a)^{10} (1+b)^{15} [1 + v(1+a)(1+b) + v^{2} (1+a)^{2} (1+a)^{2} + \dots] \\
        &= P_{x} (1+a)^{10} (1+b)^{15} [1 + (1+i^{*})^{-1} + (1+i^{*})^{-2} + \dots] \\
        &= P_{x} (1+a)^{10} (1+b)^{15} \cdot \ddot{a}_{x \mid i^{*}}
    \end{aligned}
    $$

!!! Info

    Please refer to the FAM-L notes on [Variable Benefit Contracts](../2.%20ASA-FAML/5.%20Variable%20Benefits.md).

Similar to pensions, the liability as at the current time is the above EPV discounted backwards:

$$
    \text{EPV}_{y} = \text{EPV}_{65} \cdot v^{65-y} \cdot \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{y}}
$$

Unlike Pensions, health premiums are NOT dependent on salary. Thus, there is no need to consider PUC or TUC. Instead, a **Linear Accrual** method is applied, where the EPV is scaled based on the **proportion** of the total number of working years that has been worked:

$$
    \text{Accrued Liability} = \frac{\text{Years Worked}}{\text{Total Working Years}} \cdot EPV_{y}
$$

By default, accrued liability is usually calculated based on the **earliest possible retirement age**. This simplifies the problem, as there is **only one time** point to worry about.

However, similar to pensions, some questions may allow for retirement at **multiple ages**. In this case, the total accrued liability is the **sum of the individual accrued liabilities** at each possible retirement age.

### **Funding Health Benefits**

Similar to pensions, the amount to be contributed each year is related to the reserves needed at the end of the year:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n}V &= \text{Accrued Liability} \\
    {}_{n}V + C_{n} &= {}_{n+1}V \cdot vp_{x}
\end{aligned}
$$

Thus, we can thus similarly find a simplified expression for the contribution:

$$
\begin{aligned}
    {}_{n}V &= \frac{n}{n+k} \cdot v^{65-n} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n}} \cdot P_{65} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65 \mid i^{*}} \\
    {}_{n+1}V &= \frac{n+1}{n+k} \cdot v^{65-n-1} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n+1}} \cdot P_{65} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65 \mid i^{*}} \\
    \\
    {}_{n+1}V \cdot vp_{x} 
    &= {}_{n+1}V \cdot v \frac{\ell_{n+1}}{\ell_{n}} \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n+k} \cdot v^{65-n} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n}} \cdot P_{65} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65 \mid i^{*}} \\
    &= \frac{n}{n} \cdot \frac{n+1}{n+k} 
        \cdot v^{65-n} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n}} \cdot P_{65} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65 \mid i^{*}} \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot \frac{n}{n+k}
        \cdot v^{65-n} \frac{r_{65}}{\ell_{n}} \cdot P_{65} \cdot \ddot{a}_{65 \mid i^{*}} \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot {}_{n}V \\
    \\
    \therefore C_{n}
    &= {}_{n+1}V \cdot vp_{x} - {}_{n}V \\
    &= \frac{n+1}{n} \cdot {}_{n}V - {}_{n}V \\
    &= \left(\frac{n+1}{n} - 1 \right) \cdot {}_{n}V \\
    &= \frac{n+1-n}{n} \cdot {}_{n}V \\
    &= \frac{1}{n} \cdot {}_{n}V

!!! Tip

    Notice that this is the **exact same result** as the pension contribution under a PUC basis.

    The formula typically shown shows the contribution as a function of the EPV - both result in the same outcome.
