# **Actuarial Exam Notes**

Hello!

This website is meant to a be a repository of the notes that I have used for the various SOA exams, allowing me to reference my notes on the go.

The notes were created by blending together information from multiple resources. The information is what I understand of the concepts and thus should not be taken as fact.

All images used in this website are credited in the raw markdown files that were used to build the website. If there are any issues with the use of the images, please reach out to me via Github.
